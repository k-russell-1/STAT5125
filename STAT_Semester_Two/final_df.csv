"1","PART 1 Quinn buried her head in her hands and looked at the clock that stood watch over the room. She’d heard complaints from classmates and online reviewers that time moved backwards in Professor McHugh’s classes, but she hadn’t known just how literal they were meant to be taken. Against the laws of physics and the rule of common sense, there were still twenty-five minutes left of class.  To her credit, Quinn had tried her hardest to listen all semester. She slipped in and out of her haze just enough to catch scattered phrases like ""implicit differentiation"", ""parametric coordinate system"", and ""MacLaurin series"", which so far had kept her from failing the course. Today, however, the tug of last night’s restlessness combined with the temperate beauty that was this Friday afternoon were too strong for Quinn. She knew allowing her mind to wander would only make the class go by more slowly, but she was beyond helping herself.  She looked at the students around her. From the back row, it was easy to see who was asleep, who was listening, and who was waging the war of attention in their mind.

"2","It was a record-setting day for the zone-out crowd, thought Quinn. Most students fidgeted, or stared off into the distance, or drew absentmindedly in their notebooks. Professor McHugh, sixty-five or so, author of over one hundred papers, internationally renowned for his research, dutifully continued his droning to the mindless husks that were his students.  Quinn thought back to her elementary school days, when she and her old friends would pass notes around during particularly boring classes. Wouldn’t that be a great way to kill time now? She scanned the room, and wondered what she would write, if she could be that young again.  She studied the back of the other students’ heads. It amazed her how little she knew about the rest of them. Quinn made the decision three years ago to commute to college despite the fact that almost every one of her classmates was residential. She hadn’t wanted to be too far from her family– or, what was left of it– even if it meant she would forgo the college experience she had heard so much about from her insufferable high school guidance counselor.  She could put a few names to faces in that room, but not many. Soon enough, she wondered not about what she would write on the hypothetical note, but who she would pass it to.

"3","Of course, there was always the boy with the ripped jeans to her left. Throughout the course of the semester she had caught him glancing in her direction a few times, but they hadn’t spoken. For a brief moment, she thought about how best to mess with his mind. What would he do if she slipped him the note and it was blank? What if it was a picture of McHugh? Or a fake address? Rolling her eyes at herself, she dismissed the idea and resumed her daydreaming.  Mercifully, time forged a deal with reality and agreed to move forward.  Quinn felt as though she’d just awoken from a long nap when she stood up to grab her bookbag. She would have loved to enjoy the autumn sun on the quad and read, or saunter through the campus garden and take the long way home, as she often did. But she could not afford to do any of that today. As Quinn followed the boy with the ripped jeans out of the math building, she felt the fresh air tease what the rest of the day would bring. Outwardly, her younger sister Maeve was modest, shy, even shyer than Quinn had been at her age. Somehow, their father had convinced Maeve to perform at her high school’s fall talent show, in spite of the fact that she was just a freshman. Quinn had always been impressed by Maeve’s natural propensity to be good at things– school, music, understanding people. Whenever her sister gathered the courage to show off, Quinn wanted to be there to see it. She crossed the parking lot and entered her car. Three warning lights on the dashboard greeted her. Every time she started her Impala, she swore she’d quit her job at the mini-golf course and find something else, anything else, that paid better. She wanted nothing more than to push the old piece of crap into a deep river. That, or to clean it out, and pay thousands of dollars for the repairs it so sorely needed.

"4","The more she thought about it, the more the river option appealed to her.  The traffic was slow for a Friday afternoon. Quinn jammed a CD into her old car’s disc slot and rubbed her temples. The twenty-minute drive home became thirty by way of red lights and indecisive day-drivers. Her eyes began to glaze over, aggravation building under crusted daydream sowed by the somnambulant Professor McHugh.  But as Quinn at last turned onto the high school’s street, she saw a squirrel out of the corner of her eye, sitting exactly where her tires were about to make contact with the road.  Her heart leapt, and she swerved to the right. No telltale thump. While she had avoided disaster, she scolded herself. She would have been better off hoping the squirrel moved and avoiding the risk of flipping her car.

"5","But before Quinn’s heart even had a chance to decelerate, she saw something else, this time out of her rearview mirror– an ambulance, sirens full boar, screaming down the main road. She pulled to the side and let it pass, her eyes trained on the blinking lights, red, white, yellow, as it sped ahead.  A thought raised the hairs on the back of her neck. God, please don’t go where it looks like you’re going. But it took the right turn she intended to take herself, skidded to a halt beside the main entrance, and coughed out a half dozen paramedics. Maeve’s high school was under siege by vest-wearing first responders with frazzled hair and wide eyes.  Quinn, stopped a few hundred feet from the scene, watched as drivers in front of her put on their hazard lights and hurried after the ambulance on foot. Some were younger than her, but many must have been at least her grandparents’ age. They all ran, to the best of their ability. The spectacle took the feeling from Quinn’s hands. She followed the others. The day was a handful of degrees too warm for running. A thin film of sweat formed just below her hair as she cut across pavement and pushed past others. The air itself, usually put in motion by the neverending flow of traffic, stagnant now, was reluctant to enter her lungs.",5,0,9,238,1,0.0840336134453782,0.134453781512605,0.0378151260504202,0.0378151260504202,0.0336134453781513,0.113445378151261,0.243697478991597,0.00420168067226891,0.0336134453781513,0.100840336134454,0.0210084033613445,0.147058823529412,0.0168067226890756,0,0.138655462184874,0.00420168067226891,0,0.000418459895732175,0.000418459895731242,0.672519435083775,0.00041845989573414,0.000418459895732011,0.000418459895728607,0.000418459895737286,0.32496980554183
"6","She had just reached the school’s large, grassy front lawn when swaths of teenagers began to flood out of the main entrance. Some were frantically in discussion with one another, some joked around, but most were quiet. Parents who had parked their cars on the shoulder of the road gathered in front of Quinn and muttered anxiously, scanning the tops of the adolescents’ heads. A few teachers led the students out, shouting instructions and taking counts.  Police sirens were not far behind. Three fortified cars pushed through the chaos and stopped next to the ambulance. Rows of officers, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests, strode into the school with weapons trained forward. Quinn, arching and angling her body to watch, found herself in battle against a wave of vertigo. The arrival of the police officers had caused a shift in the students’ demeanor. Many, beginning to sense the gravity of the situation, shouted and ran in every direction. Quinn searched for any hope that something harmless had happened. Maybe someone pulled a prank. Maybe a talent show warmup had gone wrong, and everyone was going to be fine. But there was a tangible gravity emanating from the school, a sickening pulse that needed to be escaped from. Everyone looked for someone else. Children called for parents, lovers called for boyfriends and girlfriends, believers cried for God.  Students continued to spill out of the building. Fillmore High wasn’t large– Quinn had graduated from there a few years ago with a class of around 150– but that day, thousands and millions ran across that grassy lot.",6,0,0,265,1,0.0716981132075472,0.135849056603774,0.060377358490566,0.0490566037735849,0.0452830188679245,0.124528301886792,0.245283018867925,0.0113207547169811,0.0377358490566038,0.0452830188679245,0.0264150943396226,0.135849056603774,0.00377358490566038,0,0.150943396226415,0,0,0.000319418061635547,0.000319418061632839,0.000319418061635143,0.000319418061632836,0.000319418061633363,0.000319418061632776,0.997764073568563,0.000319418061634082
"7","The early autumn sun bore down on Quinn. Around her, scores of loved ones reunited. Countless more waited for their chance to do so, stuck on the road behind cars that were no more than driverless shells. Fuck them, she needed to find Maeve. She pressed forward. She looked to the left. ""Maeve?"" A small child, in an embrace with his mother.  ""Maeve?"" An errant shoulder to the sternum. She coughed, and turned around.  To her right, two friends whispered in hushed tones. She nestled into a gap between two adults and attempted to address them.

"8","""Do you guys know Maeve Harper?"" she asked, her words a register above where they should have been.  They shook their heads. Their faces were blank.

"9","The crowd was growing thicker. Officers shouted for order, herded students off the grass and away from the school, but it seemed to make no difference. Any soul misfortunate enough to lose their balance among the shoving and the movement would not have lasted long.  ""Maeve!""  She was yelling, jostling, eyes wide open, scanning the faces of the mourners. Why couldn’t she find her?  ""Maeve!""

"10","She had fought all the way through to the school’s entrance, and still she couldn’t find her sister.  She climbed up onto a balcony next to a middle-aged man who was shouting on his cell phone. It should be so easy to find her from here, she thought, scanning the tops of heads through brimming tears. And though she tried to push the idea out of her mind, she was right. No one in the history of Fillmore High had redder hair than the Harper sisters.  Quinn climbed down from the balcony. Behind her, the school was empty, save for the officers and paramedics. Should she try the ambulance? No, she thought. She has to be on the field, somewhere.  But just as Quinn prepared to wedge herself back into the crowd, she saw motion in her peripheral vision. A group of five or six students and a teacher exited the high school through a side entrance. Last in that group was Maeve.

"15","It was evident that they would not move for some time. Cars, stacked in tight rows, some occupied and some empty, lined the road two, three across. Quinn, completely unsure of what Maeve had seen, decided it would be best to let her sister say something when she was ready. The result was nearly an hour of silence. Quinn watched as wave after wave of emergency response vehicles arrived on scene, mainly for the purpose of thinning the crowd from the lawn. Gradually, they found success, and all that remained were a mismatched group of adults and children, who walked around the lot aimlessly, and asked the officers questions, and refused to leave. Quinn stole glances at her sister. Her eyes didn’t change; her face didn’t change. The vehicle ahead of them snaked through an opening. It was their turn to go. There would be five more minutes of emptiness. When they arrived home, they had to park behind both her mother’s and her father’s cars in the driveway. Although her mother had promised they would both be there, it was still jarring for Quinn to see their vehicles together. Her parents had divorced five years ago, an acrid affair, one that had limited them to speaking once a month, if that frequently. For a brief moment, Quinn was twelve years old again, flatly refusing to step out of Jenny’s minivan the morning after a sleepover.  She snapped out of it quickly, though. She had to leave the car, the crowd, the scene behind. She threw her door open and led her sister across granite steps toward their father’s house.  Even before they entered, Quinn heard something remarkably familiar, in spite of the passing of time. Her mother and her father were in a shouting match.

"16","Quinn, cursing her parents’ incessant fighting, rested her hand on the doorknob. She held her breath and waited a moment before entering her home.

"17","""Anna, please! You know what the stakes are."" Quinn and Maeve stepped around the corner into the living room. Their mother, otherwise very mild, stood nose-to-nose with their father, who towered some eight inches over her. And although Mrs. Harper looked utterly disheveled– eyes red-rimmed, hair frazzled– she imposed herself upon her husband admirably.  Their father, slim, dark-haired, sharp, still in his button-down shirt and work pants, had lost his patience with her. The kids could not see his face, but it appeared as though their parents had been fighting for a while.  Their mother caught Maeve’s eye just as she was about to shout again. Instantly, she changed. She ran toward her youngest daughter and pulled her into a tight embrace.

"18","""Oh, Maeve, honey…""  Anna could not suppress heavy, shaking sobs. Even now, her sister was under the spell of stoicism.  Steven turned to the three women and his gaze softened. Every time Quinn saw him, he looked older. As his wife and daughter hugged, he addressed Quinn, and spoke to her.  ""Quinnie May,"" he said, suddenly smiling, and pulling her into an embrace of his own. ""You’re a hero, you know.

"19","Still shaken, Quinn hugged him back. This type of sentimentality from her father was rare, even for a day such as this one. Initially ready to scold him for his yelling, her voice cracked. ""I love you too, dad."" Anna released her grip on Maeve and approached Quinn. Impossibly, Anna’s crying grew even more frantic as she hugged her oldest daughter. Quinn tried to console her, but found her eyes wandering to her father and her sister.  Steven had taken a knee in front of Maeve. He spoke to her quietly, but even if he hadn’t, she wouldn’t have been able to decipher his words over the wails of her mother. Maeve listened to him for a while, and nodded her head.

"20","Anna released Quinn and began to breathe again. She studied her husband, and he studied her. Quinn thought it unmistakable that some psychic piece of information passed between the two at that moment. Steven put his arm on Maeve’s back and stood up. Wordlessly, emotionlessly, he led her out of the living room and across the hall, retracing her and Quinn’s steps, heading back outside. Quinn turned to her mother and spoke in a whisper.

"21","The front door slammed shut. Something was wrong. Where were they going, and now of all times? And so abruptly? And why couldn’t she know? Quinn drew the curtains and watched through the front window as her father led her sister into his car.   ""Where are they going?"" she repeated. Her mother had positioned herself behind Quinn, and stared outside as well. But again, she did not offer her daughter a single word in response.  The engine started outside. She was going to have to ask her father herself. Before she could even take a step in the direction of the front door, however, an ice cold hand latched on to her arm.

"22","Anna had learned to live with little– little means, little living space, little dignity– in the years following her divorce. What that had taught her was how to get by with little. Quinn was twenty-one, tallish, certainly less than a world-class athlete, but in decent shape, for her age. She should have been able to pull free of her mother’s grasp and run to her father’s car in plenty of time to ask him her question. But the lean years had given Anna a strength– a strength of body, a strength of reason, a strength of persuasiveness– that she employed every bit of to keep her daughter in check. Quinn looked into her mother’s eyes and began to doubt herself. She was probably not thinking clearly. Maybe Maeve had asked for a private ride with her dad, or maybe he was taking her to the police station, or to a counseling center. Quinn sat down on the couch and faced her mother, who was trying to be so strong for her.  The car backed out of the driveway. ./.",22,0,12,183,2,0.0601092896174863,0.136612021857924,0.0437158469945355,0.0655737704918033,0.0382513661202186,0.0819672131147541,0.234972677595628,0.0109289617486339,0.0601092896174863,0.114754098360656,0.0273224043715847,0.153005464480874,0.00546448087431694,0,0.120218579234973,0.00546448087431694,0,0.995685068375172,0.00061641880354308,0.000616418803544589,0.000616418803549951,0.000616418803545877,0.000616418803549042,0.000616418803546857,0.000616418803548214

The goal, an idea they had hatched at the start of the semester, was for them both to earn C’s in Calculus III. It had started as a joke, but morphed into a rallying cry whenever one of them began to feel lost or overwhelmed. They would whisper it to one another in class at intervals and text each other about it while they were doing their homework. It was dumb, but Quinn knew it helped. The two classmates sat on her bed and continued their work.

"35","""That’s a pretty reckless plan, if you ask me,"" he said. ""I’d call it optimistic."" replied Quinn, weakly. In reality, Quinn had been feeling less optimistic than ever about life after college. Before classes, she would overhear students talking about jobs they had lined up, or cities that they would move to, or even families that they planned to start. She couldn’t seem to bring herself to think that far ahead.  For now, though, the task at hand was tomorrow’s end-of-week quiz. The two classmates managed to familiarize themselves somewhat with the material, and by the time the last of the natural light had vanished, they decided that they would be able to at least understand their upcoming assessment.

Though her mother assured her that Maeve would be out of commission for some time, Quinn’s unanswered calls, placed first with hope and later by habit, piled up by the dozens.  Quinn found her trust in her parents fading quickly. In between calls, she hounded her mother for information. Every time, the answer was the same. ""Quinnie, please, trust them. They’ll be back."" Or, ""They can handle themselves."" Or, ""You know your father wouldn’t do anything to hurt her."" But Quinn thought her mother was trying just as hard to convince herself of her words as she was trying to convince her.

He was a senior who had run away from his home in Pennsylvania last year. He was shot with a silenced pistol in a closet near the music wing of the high school. Another loud noise alerted nearby teachers, the school began lockdown processes, and eventually every other student was reunited with their family.

"40","There was one other body in that closet– that of the primary suspect. He was an older, unidentified man, with no known prior relationship to the deceased. Oddly enough, security cameras never showed him entering the school, no witnesses stepped forward, and no other suspects or enemies were identified. Seemingly the only person who authorities believed could have had any connection to the case was the school’s principal, Edna Mills. Though she’d stepped into the role just last year following the surprise resignation of the former principal, she had quickly become well-liked by students and faculty. The poor woman endured days of questioning, but swore up and down she thought her school was safe and that she had no knowledge of any potential killer. Though she was never charged with anything, she resigned less than a week after the shooting.  Quinn found the news coverage hard to stomach. Jason’s friends talked about how kind he was, and how much he had overcome. Apparently, his original living situation had been less than ideal, and he was fortunate to have an uncle in New Jersey who would take him in. His uncle. Oh, how he wept.

Quinn did not sleep that night, either.  Days passed. Eventually, the story of the rogue father and the kidnapped daughter made its way to the local news. Quinn had to start going back to school, but she didn’t understand a word said in her classes. The eyes of her classmates poked, prodded, pushed. Did they know what had happened? Did they think it was all some hoax for popularity? Did they feel sorry for her?  The only reason she passed her classes that winter was because of a kind, if slightly creepy, classmate sitting next to her.

"47","Sometimes Quinn would sit down in her room and reminisce silently for hours. Sometimes, she would lay on Maeve’s bed and cry, if she could manage it. Some nights, she tried to pretend the whole section of the house wasn’t there. But tonight, her eye was drawn to the acoustic guitar perched on the stand next to Maeve’s dresser.  It was a real beauty of an instrument. It was made of mahogany wood, much deeper than most other guitars she’d seen. The fact that its strings were getting old and its fretboard was dusty seemed only to add character to it.  Quinn grabbed it and sat down on her bed. She remembered how effortlessly her sister, who was primarily a cellist, navigated the fretboard. Before she left, she spent some time trying to teach Quinn how to play.  Quinn’s favorite was the A chord. That was easy to play, and it was the one she always remembered. She plucked the strings one by one, the stagnant harmony ringing in her ears.

"48","She tried to maneuver her fingers into position for a F chord. Quinn had always laughed when she tried to play this one. Human fingers can’t possibly bend like that, she said. In mock frustration, she’d tell her sister that she was going to quit. Then, Maeve would grab her hands, reposition her fumbling fingers, and like magic, the chord would emerge.  For a moment, holding that instrument, Quinn felt close to Maeve. It was a feeling she struggled to grasp and one she was terrified of losing. Beneath this fleeting feeling, and with each passing day, and week, and month, she felt more and more resigned to the fact that she was never coming back.  Quinn returned the guitar to its stand and left the room. She climbed into her own bed and looked out of her window, into the night. She had to fall asleep soon, and wake up seemingly even sooner.

Without another moment’s hesitation, she started to walk towards the car. She didn’t hear Ty call out to her as she made her way back across the quad and into the parking lot. In fact, the whole world faded into colors, devoid of meaning, devoid of permanence. All that there was, and all that there would be, was that text message. She opened her car door and sat down. Through unsteady breaths, she gripped the wheel as tightly as she could. She tried to close her eyes, but she couldn’t escape the visual of the words ""guest waiting for you"", in unsettlingly polite lettering. The words stared back at her just as intensely as she stared at them.

"64","But as Quinn skidded to a stop on the shoulder of the road in front of her house, she saw no car in the driveway. Quinn had thought it might be beneficial for her mother to move out of the dingy apartment she’d lived in ever since the divorce. It had been a long, arduous process, with court dates and fancy clothes and relatives who couldn’t stand to look at one another. Although Quinn was sixteen then, and mired in the chaos and uncertainty of her own adolescent life, she could not resist exploring the dark energy that fueled the divorce proceedings. Many nights, she would stay awake well past midnight, listening to indecipherable arguing from other rooms, the words just outside the threshold of her hearing. She would wonder what life would be like with her dad, or what it would be like with her mom, or what it would be like to be separated from Maeve. She tried to gather as much information as she could, in court, at home, at night, to pick a side, to root for one outcome over the other. But she never could. The more she tried to understand, the more it seemed as though they split simply because that was who they had become. Inevitably, she wondered what ultimately caused the dam to burst. She hadn’t ever seen a physical alteration, though perhaps it was not outside the realm of possibility that something of the sort had happened. They did spar verbally often, but Quinn had thought that to be normal. What was it, then? Was it him? Was it her?  Was it me?",64,0,2,275,4,0.0509090909090909,0.112727272727273,0.0727272727272727,0.109090909090909,0.0327272727272727,0.0836363636363636,0.152727272727273,0.00727272727272727,0.0436363636363636,0.156363636363636,0.0181818181818182,0.130909090909091,0.0363636363636364,0,0.123636363636364,0,0,0.996746522099923,0.0004647825571522,0.000464782557153789,0.000464782557153122,0.000464782557154422,0.000464782557154499,0.00046478255715716,0.000464782557152345
"65","Ultimately, her mother seemed to take the entire process much harder than her father. The court ruled that most of their shared assets would belong to Steven, and Anna was so fed up with him and with the law that she moved in with her sister in New Hampshire. Before Anna left, both she and Steven had sat Quinn down and explained their version of events. Her mother, tearful and tired, promised her it wasn’t her fault, things had just spoiled between her and Dad, she’d still be around to give Quinn anything she needed, she just needed some space. Her father had said the same thing, hugged her, and returned to work before his lunch break was over.  Anna had found meager work as a substitute elementary school teacher and made almost no money. Quinn had made the trip north a handful of times since she received her drivers’ license, but there was almost no room to breathe. The apartment, the town, all of it– claustrophobic. But she never had seen her mother smile so wide as when she would open that door.  Every Sunday after the divorce, her mother would call, and Maeve, who was just nine at the time, would skip out of her seat and pick up the old-fashioned landline phone the family hung on to. The two of them would talk for fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes or more. Sometimes Maeve would be up long past her bedtime talking and laughing with her mother. Steven always allowed this. But he never talked to her himself, except to say goodbye.  Quinn had hoped in a distant silver-lining sense that returning back home and being free of Steven would help to restart her mother’s life, or at the very least to bridge the gap that had formed between her and her oldest daughter. But the years, and the disappearance of Maeve, had taken their toll. Anna leveraged her doctorate in biology to work nights as a custodian, which forced her to sleep during the days, and she rarely left the house for anything else. As she marked time, Quinn tried her best to live around her.

"68","Where the hell is she? Quinn had to breathe. She threw open the door and stepped outside. Two squirrels chased one another across the stone walkway that connected the house’s front stoop to the driveway. Across the street, her neighbor pushed a lawn mower through his yard. Around and around they went. Quinn shook her head and grabbed her phone (sporting a fresh crack down the middle) and hurried inside her house. That day last fall was the fastest she had ever seen life move. She thought there was no possibility of a day, a moment, ever coming to be as dizzying as that one outside of the high school. She was wrong.  She considered her options while pacing across the living room. There weren’t many. She could wait at home, calling her mother, ignoring the message; this way, with any luck, she could find help, or if not, rob some sick prankster or malicious scam artist of some kind of satisfaction.

"69","Alternatively, she could act.  That message. For all she knew, she may have been given false information. She pulled out her phone and searched for the address. Sure enough, Allensburg was a real town, and 827 Fairview Road was a real place. It was an old-looking building, standing maybe four stories tall, buried behind a chain link fence and what looked to be thick rows of forest. It was constructed with old, weathered bricks, and vines grew on all of its walls. Windows, some covered with plywood, and still others broken, looked out onto the lonely road that connected the building to the rest of the world.  Maeve shouldn’t be there.

"73","But how stupid it was! Quinn could count on one hand the number of times she had ever left her home state of New Jersey, and she had to prepare to go across the country by car over the span of three days on a rescue mission to save her sister. A rescue mission, by herself. She was sure she’d seen a movie– no, a television show– just like it. She laughed out loud, a nervous, chattering laugh that was foreign to her ears. How did that show end?  That’s right. I never finished it. Working further against her was that she still had no name. The rational conclusion she should have arrived at was that some sadistic student had come upon her number somehow, probably from college, and was getting a laugh out of messing with her. She was easy pickings, after all. Not very social, a public incident in the recent past. The message, combined with the hidden identity, and the request to keep the police uninvolved, reeked of dishonesty. But that phrase– if you want to see her again– there was no way she could not see it through.  So, against her better judgment, she raced up the stairs to grab her bag. As she threw a few days’ worth of clothes in it, she wondered what exactly she would need for this excursion, should it be legitimate. This mysterious text figure hadn’t ever mentioned a transfer of money. Was this person just going to meet with Quinn at the ivy-covered building and hand Maeve over? Would Quinn have to do something in exchange for her? And where was her father in all of this?",73,0,10,282,4,0.0673758865248227,0.113475177304965,0.0709219858156028,0.0709219858156028,0.024822695035461,0.102836879432624,0.177304964539007,0.00709219858156028,0.0425531914893617,0.141843971631206,0.0212765957446809,0.141843971631206,0.0212765957446809,0,0.138297872340426,0.00354609929078014,0,0.111524448841805,0.0571508564883532,0.00045362362062727,0.0004536236206197,0.829056576566727,0.000453623620625405,0.000453623620621258,0.000453623620620592
"74","The more Quinn thought about what she may be getting into, the less it all made sense. So she decided to focus on her breathing, and what to bring. Would she need a weapon? There were no guns in the house. And for all she knew, someone was out there, following her every move. They managed to get her phone number. If she went to buy a weapon, would this person know about it? If she brought one on her ride, would that ruin something? Plans and fears flashed in her mind. She lept in logic, played with ideas that were just as plausible as they were fantastical.  She considered texting the number back, but decided against it. Yes, she needed to know what to bring, what to expect, what to do, but calling was against the rules. What if sending off-topic text messages was, too? Returning downstairs, she caught a gleam from the kitchen. Next to the stove, a magnetic block of wood displayed three knives, each larger than the last. Quinn looked over her shoulder, certain that someone was watching, but the house was as still as it ever had been.

"76","Quinn made one more pass through the house to ensure she had packed everything she needed.  As she reached the upstairs landing, she stepped on a particularly creaky patch of floor, one that had been notorious for announcing its existence to the rest of the house for as long as Quinn could remember. It was directly in front of Maeve’s room. Maeve’s room, ajar, looking into her, pleading. Make me whole again. Quinn shut the door and went back downstairs. It was still only 3 o’clock. She threw her bag onto the coffee table, sat on her couch, and turned on the television. It was a Friends rerun. She had never found the episodes very funny, but she did enjoy them. The show brought her back to middle school, when her father used to sit her down at the table and help her with math homework, or essays, as the laugh track drifted into the dining room table.

"77","Her father wasn’t home much back then, but when he was, he was always ready to help her. Homework, girl scout projects, even video games. Quinn remembered one night, when she was very little, being stuck on a level of an old racing game that she loved to play. Just as she was about to give up and go to bed, her father came home from work, and upon hearing what was happening, beat the level on the first try. Her ten-year-old self absolutely thought him a superhero that night.  Interspersed throughout those times, and even after the messy divorce, were dozens of small superhero moments. Throughout the past few months, Quinn had been asked about her father countless times, from other family members, acquaintances, and curious news-watching onlookers. She always struggled to feel she could describe him well. Steven, the truant, distant superhero.  She could only imagine where he was and what he was doing now.

But she focused on the weight of her feet on the floor, and the water on her head, and the steam in the air.  As the minutes passed, the images of the corpse and of Ty came in and out of her mind. But slowly, she felt reality start to win out over her dream.  ""You’re telling me I have to think about it again in the morning?"" asked Quinn, incredulously. ""I am, and I wish I didn’t have to.

"101","Quinn fidgeted on the couch. Her eyes were dry and her muscles ached, but she had spent so much of her life in rough shape after a fruitless night of sleep that she hardly noticed anything out of the ordinary. In front of her was the bag she had packed yesterday, and a small collection of some snacks for the road. Each of the colorful plastic bags featured processed food that seemed equally inedible to her.  She had been on that couch for some time, turning around to check for Ty through the blinds every few minutes. Different scenarios ran through her mind. Would it all just be a big prank? Would they be trafficked to another country? Would they be robbed at gunpoint? The more she sat and thought, the more wild her ideas became.  Behind her dread, however, was the illuminating, poisonous hope that within seventy-two hours, she would be able to bring her sister home. She hadn’t heard anything about her father in the text message, but sometimes, she would let herself imagine that they were together in Colorado as a part of some big misunderstanding, and everything in her home could go back to the way it had been six months ago. That was, of course, until she remembered that her mother was still gone. Surely, she must be at one of her friend’s houses, or maybe she had some meeting. Maybe she even met someone new, thought Quinn, daring to smile. But she couldn’t linger on it. She had bigger things to worry about.  She heard a rumble from outside at 7:25. She jumped up, grabbed her bags, and opened the front door.

She parked, grabbed her backpack, and walked on aching feet across the uneven cobblestone steps that led toward her home’s front door.  The smell hit her as soon as she opened the door.

"130","Quinn smiled. She had been hoping for this kind of reaction from her sister.  Maeve continued to run her mouth wildly as they approached the Prudential Hall for their concert. After they parked, they had to practically run into the building for the 7:30 start time.  The stage lights dimmed just as they took their seats. They were up on the fourth row, in the corner furthest from the stage. They really were probably the worst seats in the house. But Maeve could not have seemed to care less. Quinn had never seen her so enraptured by anything.  The music was wild, but bright. There were only three members of the group– a keyboardist, a drummer, and a singer, who rarely was on stage. They played at breakneck speeds, moving together in unisons that seemed at first illogical and then downright impossible. It wasn’t the type of music Quinn would seek out and listen to, but it didn’t matter.

Paint chipped off the doors, tall grass grew in the cracks of the sidewalk outside the rooms, and a number of windows were either boarded up or broken. (Quinn was beginning to notice a theme.) There were a few stores that sparsely populated the road the motel was on, but it seemed like a great place to hide from society.

Quinn and Ty headed out of the reception area and toward their own room. As they walked, they heard some adult sounds coming from at least three other rooms. They tried not to think about that.  Quinn opened the door. Room 116 was small, and just as uninviting as the rest of the motel. Ugly brown wallpaper peeled everywhere, the carpet was dug up in some places, and the bed was sloppily made. The door to the bathroom was open a few inches, and Quinn didn’t even want to think about what was waiting for her in there.  In front of the bed was an old television, mounted on a cart with wheels. Quinn hadn’t seen anything like that since she was in elementary school. It had a VHS tape slot, and hanging from it was a tape. Surely, this was the promised ""proof of life"".

The floor, walls, and ceiling seemed all to be made up of the same type of tile, except for the furthest wall from the camera, which featured a wooden door, also painted white, and what Quinn could only assume to be a two-way mirror. A young girl sat against the opposite wall. She wore a gray hospital gown, and on her feet were two black ankle-length socks. She seemed to be staring at the door.  Was that Maeve?

After a few steps, however, it stopped in its tracks. It was tough to make out exactly what it was doing on the video, but it looked like it cocked its ears back and turned its head, as though trying to locate a sharp sound.  The girl brought her hands to her face. The dog started pedaling backwards, ears flat against its head, tail wagging ferociously. It bared its teeth and began to growl.

The girl removed her hands from her head, and stood up. At that moment, the door swung open once more, and a tall, thin man with pale skin and dark hair entered the room.  He was built much like Quinn’s father.  The man walked over to the girl and pulled her into an embrace.

It all seemed so shortsighted, now that the moment was actually here.  As her thoughts continued to swirl, the door she was staring at opened, and a friendly face appeared. Jenny, dressed in all black and holding her violin, immediately spotted Quinn and sat down in the vacant chair next to her. ""Closing night,"" she said. Quinn nodded absently.

She was going to fold, right there, in front of everyone. Her lines, and her performance, had utterly vacated her mind. The music started. The music. Jenny was down in the pit somewhere, rooting for her. In a moment of desperate brilliance, Quinn slid her to the forefront of her consciousness.

"168","She was a headstrong peasant’s wife who, after falling for a nobleman, vowed to leave her abusive husband and woo her real love interest. After stealing a gown to wear to a formal ball, she confesses her love to the nobleman, who loves her back, thinking her to be wealthy as well. When her husband finds out what she has done, he nearly kills her in a fit of drunken rage, but the nobleman kills him before he can deal her a final blow. As she lays there, dying in the nobleman’s arms, he uses the power of love to bring her back from the dead. Quinn knew that the play was derivative, oddly paced, and potentially problematic thematically. But Mr. Abrams’ wife had written it, Mr. Abrams loved it, and Quinn was determined to put on a show.

"215","Quinn opened the trunk and grabbed her bag, and Ty did the same. Quinn couldn’t help but notice that her bag seemed to weigh much more on her shoulder than it had on Friday.  They made their way across the parking lot and entered the hotel lobby. It could not have been more different than the reception area at the motel. The floor and walls were made of marble, an ornate fountain gently bubbled in the center of the room, and three well-dressed employees manned the front desk. Soft jazz played quietly from overhead speakers, and men in expensive suits walked past them, talking and laughing amongst themselves.  Suddenly, Quinn, in her plaid button-down shirt and old denim jeans, felt a bit out of place. She hurried her way up to the front desk.  ""Room for two, please.

"216","""Certainly, ma’am. One moment, please."" The young woman typed on her keyboard for a moment. Quinn’s eyes wandered. Was anyone watching them? Listening to them? A handful of people lingered in the lobby, but as far as she could tell, no one was giving them a second glance.  ""You’re all set! It will be room eleven-sixteen, and the elevator is just past this desk and to your right. If you need anything, you can call the desk at any point. Although…"" She looked at her computer screen.

He stood behind her, shoulders slumped, eyes blankly forward, examining the hotel’s logo printed on the desk. She grabbed his hand and led him toward the elevator.  That seemed to wake him up a bit.

"220","At that moment, the elevator reached the eleventh floor, and the doors glided open. Moving silently, the two walked to their room.  Quinn went to open the door, but stopped herself. Her hands were shaking, and her pulse sounded in her ears. With fragmented breath, she put her bag down on the floor, unzipped it, and reached for the steak knife inside. She stored it inside of her jeans on her left hip, and pulled her shirt down to conceal it.  Ty looked at her frantically. She put her finger to her lips.  Quinn removed the key card from her other pocket and unlocked the door with a small click. She opened the door slowly, and reached directly for the light switch.

"224","Quinn lied down and put her head down on the pillow. She did not feel tired. In fact, she wasn’t sure how she would fall asleep after such an unsettling day, which itself lurked in the ominous shadow of tomorrow.  She turned to face Ty’s bed. She hoped he was alright. It must have been burdensome enough for him, traveling for two days to protect her. But to do it now with a fever?  As she thought, her eyes wandered around the room, as they often did. She looked from the overpriced water bottle on the desk next to the large, mounted television to the hypnotizing wallpaper and landed on the travel brochure folded on the nightstand in between the two beds.  It certainly advertised Denver well. Enthusiastic young people hiked, rode bicycles, and stared in amazement at various aquatic animals on the front cover. But Quinn wasn’t staring at that. Past the brochure, and tucked neatly away behind the alarm clock, was an old camcorder, with a memory card stacked on top.

She showed him the camera. His eyes widened, and he ran back to the sink to spit. Quinn opened the device, and put in the memory card. The pit in her stomach returned as she navigated to the only video saved on the card.  Ty came back into the room, and sat next to her.

"226","Quinn played the video. It depicted the same room from the VHS video, with dazzling white walls and a two-way mirror. This time, however, someone was recording the room from the inside with the camcorder.  The unsteady shot panned to the mirrored wall, and the identity of the cameraman was revealed. She was short and fair-skinned, with medium-length blond hair. She wore a lab coat over a suit and dress pants, and could not have been older than thirty.  The door opened. The ginger-haired girl from last night’s tape strode into the room. The camera followed her every calculated movement. There was no mistaking it this time. The girl was Maeve.  She kept her eyes trained forward as she walked in what looked like a conscious effort to ignore the young man. When she reached the wall opposite the mirror, she turned around and sat down with her knees to her chest and her back against the wall.

"227","A voice, over the loudspeaker, rang out. ""Location attempt one, 3-25-23.""  The camera swung back to the door next to the mirror to capture a thin older woman stepping confidently into the room. She wore long black heels that clicked with every step, and dragged an old television on a cart behind her, much like the one Ty and Quinn found in the motel.  She stopped a few feet in front of Maeve, and pressed the power button on the television. The cameraman stood behind the woman, so it was impossible to tell what was playing, but it was clear that Maeve did not want to watch. She kept staring forward, refusing to acknowledge that anything or anyone else was in the room with her.  The woman turned around to give the camera a scowl. Then, she spoke to Maeve.

"228","Finally, Maeve looked up at her. It was hard to tell exactly what was going on in her face, but it appeared as though for one moment, she projected every ounce of hatred that she had at the woman. Quinn knew that look well.

And whoever was texting her had to be  connected to her poor sister in some way. Ty reached around Quinn and put his hand on her shoulder. She tensed up. He pulled his hand back, pretending as though he spotted a piece of lint on her shirt.  Suddenly, the weight of the last two days overwhelmed her.

He resumed the video, looking everywhere for clues. Quinn was turned away from him, facing the large window that looked out on Denver. Although the heart of the city must have been a few miles away from where they were staying, it was still possible to make out some brightly lit, impossibly tall buildings in the distance. Quinn thought it odd that some people lived forever in a place which always shielded itself from darkness. The glow was almost enough to make her eyes burn, even from her bed, some distance away.  She listened to the video two, then three, then four more times as Ty replayed it in search of more clues. Finally, the noise stopped for a moment. Quinn turned over in her bed. Ty was sound asleep, clutching the camera in his right hand.

"234","She slowly stood up and took it from him. He did not move a muscle.  As she went to get ready for bed, she took a turn at rewatching the video again. Quinn could not push Maeve’s look of utter disdain toward the older woman out of her mind. Sure, she got annoyed sometimes; she was fifteen, after all. Quinn could never hope to count the number of times her younger sister had rolled her eyes at her over the past few years. But Maeve’s look on the camera was much different. Quinn would have never guessed that she was capable of sending so much vitriol to another person just through a gaze. If there was any doubt before, this look confirmed it– something was very wrong at the facility she’d be arriving at tomorrow morning.  She eventually crawled under her covers, and played the video over and over again until her mind grew fuzzy with fatigue. Who was Maeve getting, and how? The attempt was… pending? Was this some psychic test, or something? The questions spun in Quinn’s head until she, too, fell asleep, clutching the camera in her hand.  ./.",234,0,-6,195,13,0.0564102564102564,0.107692307692308,0.112820512820513,0.0717948717948718,0.0307692307692308,0.0871794871794872,0.158974358974359,0.00512820512820513,0.0358974358974359,0.128205128205128,0.0358974358974359,0.143589743589744,0.0256410256410256,0,0.128205128205128,0.0153846153846154,0,0.000616418803555757,0.00061641880354864,0.000616418803557551,0.713711788742053,0.00061641880355985,0.00061641880355799,0.000616418803553381,0.282589698436614
"235","It was almost 2:55, and she could not be late. Quinn gave a quick wave of thanks to Mr. Jones, her English teacher, and stuffed her college essay draft into her backpack. As soon as she exited his room, she began to jog. It was a long way– across the whole school and down three flights of stairs, in fact– to the girls’ locker room.  As she ran, students and teachers roaming the halls looked quizzically at her, but she didn’t care. It wasn’t every day that Coach DiAngelo offered one of her players a private lesson, and Quinn wasn’t about to let the opportunity go to waste.  With legs and lungs beginning to burn, she finally reached the locker room’s landing, and pushed open the doors.  Damn it. There was the basketball team, getting ready for practice. The group of eight or nine, already changed into their uniforms, played music from a speaker and talked loudly among themselves. Quinn would have to walk through them to get to her locker.

""Everyone watch out, I think she’s gonna kill someone with that bow for real this time!"" Her heart leapt in her throat. It was Sadie. Of course it was Sadie.

Even more than the process of firing arrow after arrow, Quinn loved the temporary mental silence that seemed so unobtainable in her daily life. It was just her out there, breathing through shot after shot, with no day behind her and no night ahead of her. It was the same feeling she’d been able to enjoy years ago when she was on stage. She found herself, completely lost in the moment.  It had been a few hours before a light swishing of footsteps through the grass snapped Quinn back to reality.

It kept eating, completely oblivious to what was going on behind it. Quinn squinted her right eye, pulled back with her left hand, and breathed in. Maybe she was aiming too high to properly scare it. At the last moment, she lowered her bow a fraction of an inch.  She fired.

Mentally, she hadn’t been in that field, on that day, much at all since it happened. Yet the events in that night’s dream seemed even more vivid to her than those at the theater her freshman year.  After she had gulped two glassfuls of water, she checked the time on her phone. 4:10. She hadn’t slept much more than an hour, but her alarm was set to ring in fifteen minutes. There was no use in trying to go back to bed. The room was dark and still.

This morning, the two seemed indistinguishable. The water stung her skin. She tried to empty her mind, and recount the previous night, but she could not seem to ignore the steady prickle of the high-powered faucet.

She said the words that Bill had told her to say, and walked to her locker, without checking to see whether Mr. Lin had heard or understood them. And, as surely as death itself, the unsilenced shot rang out just as she knelt down over her cello case.  Some students ran for the exit. Others hid in the room. Still others froze, or screamed, or hugged each other. Maeve, hardly in control of her hands, continued to open her cello case, and grabbed some extra rosin she had stored in one of the compartments.

But as the effects of the uneven rest she had taken quickly wore off, the reality of her situation quickly set in. She didn’t know if she was going to be safe at all. For all she knew, she was in a coffin, escorted by some anonymously indifferent chaperone. How important you are. Whatever that meant.  The plane slowly wheeled to its gate. Images of the dead student went off like hidden bombs in the minefield that was her mind. If she let her mind wander for even a moment, something was sure to explode.

The field sloped upward to a hill, and she was running toward it, as fast as she could, to see the view from the top. She smelled grass and the flowers, and heard birds calling from tall trees at the edge of the field. The air was cool on her skin as she ran, and the evening sun began to tint the edge of the horizon pink.  The image hung in her mind so powerfully that she thought it must have been a deep-set memory. Standing up to depart the plane, she tried to hang onto it as long as she could.

Her father stopped in front of a cheery young woman, who held a sign that read ""Joseph and Elizabeth McAllister"". She looked at them expectantly.  ""Mr. McAllister?"" she asked at them.

Maeve tried to concentrate on the small sound of her footsteps moving on the pavement.  Finally, they reached an expensive-looking car with heavily tinted windows. The woman unlocked the car and invited Maeve into the passenger's seat. She looked toward her father, but he already seemed to be stepping into the back seat. What was going on?  Maeve sat down, and the young woman sat behind the wheel. She slammed the door closed, which made Maeve jump, and looked through the darkened windows at the sleepy lot around them. No one was there, and even if they were, there was no way they would be able to see inside the car. Maeve felt the walls of the vehicle close in. But the young woman, also noticing that they had privacy in the car, turned to Maeve, smiled, and extended her hand. ""Hello, Maeve. My name is Elyse. And I'm sure you have a lot of questions.""

Elyse led Maeve and her quiet father under the oversized Grand Royal Denver sign and into the lobby. It was dazzlingly white– the floor and walls were made of expensive-looking marble. A massive, ornate glass chandelier dangled multiple stories above them, and an odd silver sculpture was positioned next to the row of elevators. Even the people that walked by wore perfect suits and dresses. Everything seemed far too lavish. This was not like any other hotel Maeve had been to before.  Elyse approached the front desk.

"359","Maeve couldn’t help but notice how run-down the exterior of the building looked. Withering vines climbed up old, chipped bricks that made up four stories’ worth of walls, and barred windows looked out upon dense trees that made the area feel even more remote than it was. This clearly wasn’t a place that was going to attract any outside attention.  Elyse unlocked the front door with a key, and invited Maeve to step inside. It appeared as though the building–an old hospital, by the look of it– hadn’t been used in years. They were in a waiting room, and an old, dusty desk kept watch of the scene in front of them. The lights flickered, chairs were overturned, mold grew on the ceiling, and loose straw and rocks littered every corner of the room. The smell of mildew and mothballs nearly made Maeve gag.  ""Sorry about this,"" Elyse muttered, hurrying past the reception desk and through a rusted steel door. ""I’ve asked them to clean up a bit, but they say it’s safer this way."" ""Them.

They strode past open hospital rooms that had been refurbished into office spaces. Water coolers, contemporary paintings, and a few mounted television screens dotted their path.

Each and every one seemed so eager to meet her– seemed so starstruck, even– so that she began to feel less like a human being and more like a prized lab rat.  Once all of the suits at the table had shaken her hand and once Maeve’s mouth produced one last empty ""Hello there"" or ""Thank you very much"" or ""I’ve never been so terrified in my life"" (she could not have been sure which of the three had come out), Elyse waved goodbye to the room and led her away.

The room, not any bigger than her own at home, featured soft yellow walls and a single fluorescent light that hummed ever so softly on the ceiling. A twin bed with off-white sheets lay underneath a single window, barred from the outside and tinted, like Elyses’ car’s, presumably to give the appearance that the old building was indeed abandoned to any passerby. A completely barren desk sat next to the door that led out to the hallway. The floor was, unlike the hallway, fitted with carpet, and a small door at the corner of the room revealed a spotless bathroom. ""Personal bathroom– pretty nice, huh?"" said Elyse.

"371","But she would never hear the food’s collision with the plate thanks to the deafening roar of adolescence that was Allensburg High’s B-lunch wave. Three rows of twenty foldable tables were packed to the brim with adolescents, each one vying to be louder than the next.  Out of the corner of her eye, Maeve saw a group of boys huddling around a makeshift slingshot made of a spoon and a rubber band that threatened to fire applesauce over at another table. At that table, the oblivious soon-to-be victims flipped water bottles onto their fingers. The masochistic act was accompanied with a loud boom every time the mostly full water bottle came down upon someone’s digits. Everyone watching exclaimed with delight when the punishment came to pass.  Laughter. There was so much laughter in that oversized room. Selfish, anarchistic laughter. It was not so different from Fillmore.  Maeve, who had come late to lunch that day and long after seats were unofficially assigned, had managed to find an empty half of a table.

"372","Every so often, she felt a pair of eyes inquisitively linger upon her from across the table. But every time she looked back to check, the eyes were gone.  Maeve looked up at the clock. There were still twenty minutes left of lunch. There were so many faces in the room. Yet not one dared to meet hers today.  She sat alone, playing grimly with the runny applesauce and wishing for the fix of social novocaine that was her cell phone. Her father had hung onto it after he split up with Elyse and her at the hotel, and she hadn’t seen it since. If getting it back means seeing him again, she’d thought that night, so be it. Today, however, she felt much differently. She spotted a few students who buried their faces in their phones, escaping to their over-saturated, heavily-personalized worlds. Maeve sorely missed her own.  It had been another lengthy five minutes of studying the grooves of the wooden table when she heard a pair of clicking footsteps approaching her through the sea of cafeteria noise. She turned around to see Mr. Jones, old-timey dress shoes and all, who offered her a small smile as he reached the table.

Maeve knew that any and all hope of making friends on her first day would be extinguished if she was seen sitting with her homeroom teacher at lunch. Since she had been feeling quite lonely, though, she shook her head and let Mr. Jones sit across from her.  He was a rather tall, wiry man, who wore a colorful button-down shirt and sported a thick mustache. He taught upper-level history, so Maeve didn’t have him for class, but she got the sense during homeroom that Mr. Jones was not very well-respected by students.

""The second thing,"" Mr. Jones continued, undeterred, ""is that I know that big moves can tend to put stress on some home environments.

"379","Maeve sat at the front of the room at a long black table. The class had been going on like this for quite a while. There was a quiz last Friday, which Maeve had obviously missed. Mrs. Kingston was intent on reviewing every answer in incredible detail, which was rather unfortunate for Maeve, as she was the only student in the class without a completed quiz in front of her.  She wouldn’t have been listening even if she had taken the quiz, though. After lunch, she had developed a splitting headache, which was rather uncommon for her. She had split much of the forty minute period between massaging her temples and staring at the red second hand of the old clock above the blackboard.  Tick, tick. How deliberately it moved. It scorned Maeve’s internal pleas to move faster; laughed at them, even. I am not yours to control, it jeered. Your reality is my domain. Ultimately, impossibly, and yet inevitably, however, it would finally complete its journey. As Ryley was about to expand upon the difference between ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, the shrill bell marked the end of the day. The screaming of metal against metal made Maeve’s head pound. Yet it offered her a beautiful sense of release.

"380","She grabbed her books and made her way to her locker. Walking was dreadful. Each step she took tightened the band around her skull. By the time she had gathered her bookbag, the pain was nearly enough to make her sick. The club fair was the last place she wanted to linger, but since it was on the way to the school’s designated pick-up spot, she struck a deal with herself. I’ll walk into the cafeteria, I’ll turn left, and I’ll sign up with the first booth I see. She wasn’t looking for any particular club, after all. She just wanted something to take her mind off of what was, unimaginably, her real life.  After an arduous journey down the stairs and across the first floor of the school, Maeve found herself standing at the entrance of the cafeteria.  The cavernous room was once again filled with noise, but it was of a different timbre. This noise was of small talk, and logistics, and cleverly disguised sales pitches. The ocean was much more polite than it had been during lunch, but its cleverly veiled inauthenticity made it feel that much more suffocating to Maeve.

Allensburg Faux Trading club adorned the oversized sign at the top of the stand. Standing behind stacks of fliers and customized pens atop green velvet cloth, and sporting slicked-back hairstyles and cufflinks, were two of the boys that were hurling applesauce less than two hours prior.

She slid her queen diagonally, and pressed her side of the clock. She examined her move again, now that it had emerged from her mental alcove onto the cheap wooden board, which sat on the cafeteria table, still dirty from the afternoon’s last lunch wave.  She studied him now, as he thought through the ramifications of her move. Or perhaps he was thinking about something else. Perhaps he was thinking about his opponent’s stupidity, or how her hair was quite frizzy today. Or about her shoes, or about her readily apparent lack of friends. No, no, of course he wasn’t thinking about any of that. He couldn’t be.

"398","As he sat in silent thought, he played with the flap of his ear, which was adorned with a stud earring. He halfheartedly fiddled with it much like an uninterested dog may scratch away a flea.  He started to make a move with a pawn, turned his head, and reached instead for his knight, already in the center of the board. He took Maeve’s knight, studied the move, and pressed his side of the clock.  Maeve pulled herself away from his earring and found that her plan had worked perfectly. She was filled with relief. She wasn’t going to be laughed out of the club. Not yet, at least.  She reached for her queen and moved it once again, this time capturing a pawn adjacent to the white king.

Maeve sighed and reached for her bishop, which stared directly at his king. She slid her piece across the board and picked up his.  His face changed color. For one excruciating moment, neither player knew what to say. But suddenly, Cassius broke out into a fit of laughter.

Gone, however, were the large meeting table and the dozen or so sharply-dressed employees. In their place was a chair not unlike the one Maeve sat in when she’d gone to the dentist back in New Jersey. Replacing the adjustable light that commonly hovered above the adjustable seat was a television screen, perhaps two feet by two feet in length, that was connected via metal rods to the ceiling.  Outside of this chair, the room felt concerningly empty. Feet of carpeted floor sprawled in every direction under the dim light. The walls were barren, and any cupboards or desks that may have been in the room at some point were removed. In fact, the only items of interest in the room other than that chair were a small vent on an adjacent wall and a closet door tucked away in the far corner of the room.  President Dorothy led her past the chair and toward this door.

She could not have been sure whether President Dorothy was concerned, or amused, or if she even cared at all. She wasn’t watching her. The only things that existed were the closet door and the heavy, defiling crimson pool.  After she’d lay there and cried and screamed and seen for hours, she felt a hand touch her shoulder.

Although I won’t promise that your hard work is over, I can make you two guarantees regarding these weekly lessons. The first is that no physical harm will ever come to you. My goal– and the goal of my staff, who you’ll work more closely with in the coming weeks– is for you to feel whole again. You were broken– you are broken. It is our job to build you back up again.""

If you have burning thoughts, or dreams, or visions; if you don’t feel well, or if you at any point feel unsafe– I need to know, to help you. And If you’re open with me, then I will be open to you. At the end of each lesson, you may ask me whatever it is you wish to know. Anything. And I will answer truthfully, as a symbol of the trust between you and myself.""

At regular intervals he would take his water bottle and noisily raise it to his mouth with great fervor. He had recently resorted to using a student file to fan himself in a vain attempt to evade the relentless mid-June New Jersey heat.  Maeve hardly noticed him, however.  She had used her ample time in that stifling classroom to reflect upon the events that had gotten her there in the first place. She wasn’t used to sitting in detention. In fact, this was her first time. But, as she had reasoned, it wasn’t her fault.  She felt Alexa’s presence across the room from her.

"430","Maeve carefully traced a number of t’s into her notebook in an attempt to make one that she thought was perfect. It was almost 2:30, which meant that she would finally be free from the prison that was eighth period biology. She hadn’t been paying any attention to the class material for much of the period. Instead, she had been flipping through the blank pages of her notebook and staring disappointedly at the few sentences of nothing that she had managed to write over the past few days.  She had really meant it when she told President Dorothy that she would give journaling a try. Then again, she was not exactly thinking clearly when she had made that promise. As far as she could remember, she hadn’t ever felt as overwhelmingly terrified as she had during her lesson last Friday. Or relieved. It was odd.  Ultimately, the old woman was probably right about one thing, though– journaling should have been the escape. Maeve had plenty of thoughts to write down; that much was certain. But she felt as though every time she found it in herself to sit down to write, some barrier blocked the connection between her mind and her hand. So, after four days, she was stuck with a small handful of meaningless letters. She absentmindedly smudged her eraser over some of the ""t""’s that she produced. She wasn’t scared that anyone else would read her journal, really. In fact, she could have just as easily written in one of the school notebooks that she kept in her backpack, and no one would be the wiser. There was just something about the documentation process that she was invariably hung up on.",430,0,-9,289,28,0.0588235294117647,0.100346020761246,0.0968858131487889,0.103806228373702,0.0173010380622837,0.0865051903114187,0.152249134948097,0.0173010380622837,0.0311418685121107,0.145328719723183,0.013840830449827,0.114186851211073,0.0484429065743945,0,0.121107266435986,0,0,0.996970122929425,0.000432839581507846,0.000432839581514766,0.000432839581512262,0.000432839581507482,0.00043283958151392,0.000432839581507841,0.000432839581511247
"431","The piercing wail of the metal bell pulled Maeve out of her thoughts. She quickly grabbed her belongings and hurried through cliques of high schoolers toward the auditorium. After what had seemed like months, it was finally time for chess club again.  As she turned into the cafeteria, she squeezed past some rather rowdy members of the school’s volleyball team to see Keegan and Tess, who were already locked in concentration over a board.  Tess, playing as black, wordlessly reached for a piece, hesitated a moment, and then committed to moving it. As she tapped her side of the clock next to the board, Keegan looked up at her with visible confusion. Maeve, who had approached the board, was confused as well.

But again, for an hour on Wednesday, Maeve felt as though she was actually breathing. Her life for the past two weeks had been an incessant stream of noticing, and thinking, and thinking about thinking, so much so that the hour of mental ease could have been a front row seat to every Pinky Meteor show in North America. Most days, after school, she had no reason to emerge from her room. What was there to do? Homework was a diversion more than a nuisance, sleep a pastime rather than a bodily function. Maeve had never known isolation to be so exhausting.  But even when the two chess players were not talking, even when Maeve was staring at the board, terrified of making a horrible mistake, things were different. She was really and truly alright.  The after school bell snapped the pair out of their concentration and prompted Keegan to stand up.

But she could not help herself from turning to take one last look at the table at which she had been playing. Funnily enough, Keegan was there, talking to Cassius, who had not moved an inch since she had left.

Her face, bathed in white light, remained as still and expressionless as it had been since she had returned to her room some two hours ago. Her feet, and her anxious heart, both tapped away wildly. As afternoon gave way to dusk, Maeve sat upright on her bed and refreshed her email, hoping against hope for the email that she dreaded more than anything.

"444","Elyse paused for a moment, still outside. ""Alright. But promise me you’ll eat."" Maeve wasn’t listening. All she could seem to focus on was the look that Cassius had given her in the hallway. How was it possible that he, the one who asked for her number, was the one to give her such a pitiful, confused look? It was as though she’d said yes and then he’d revoked his offer.  Maeve stretched her back. There was no more use in waiting like this– at least, not when it caused her so much discomfort. She grimly placed her school laptop on the floor and set her head down on the pillow. Most nights, to fall asleep, she would try to picture in vivid detail her room back at home in New Jersey. She would see every panel in the windows beside her bed; every fret on the old acoustic guitar she had resting against the wall; even the chips in the paint behind the posters that she hung on her wall. It brought her a sense of calm, this pretense.  Today, as she burrowed under her covers, with heavy school clothes and winter boots still on, she looked at her laptop, and tried as hard as she could to imagine it as a phone. She could text Cassius. She could see what her friends were up to. Heck, she could call them. Or the police. She might be home by tomorrow.

"445","Of course, she could do most of these things anyway if hers was a regular laptop. Unfortunately, nearly every site was blocked except her school’s own, and she could only send emails within the school system. And even if she could somehow bypass these limitations, she was beyond terrified to risk being caught by President Dorothy, or one of her mysterious employees, whose collective absences made the already large facility seem absolutely cavernous. What would they do, if they caught her? After all, no outside communication was one of the few rules they had ever laid out. So she stayed in her bed, eyes open, pretending and considering. She heard the small tap of what she assumed to be Elyse putting her food outside of the room, but she did not feel much like emerging from her mind. So she continued to think. All of her teachers had always raved about her– so quiet, they said, so mature for her age. But when she had been playing chess with Cassius, in spite of everything that had happened in the last two weeks, in spite of the high-brow reputation she thought chess itself had, she could not have felt further from quiet and mature. It was as though his mere presence made words and jokes and laughter spill out, like she was a completely different person.   Only a few people had that kind of effect on her. Of course, Alexa did. Her friend’s name shot through her mind like a bolt of lightning. When Alexa wasn’t being a complete idiot, as she was often, she was so funny, and so thoughtful. And so loyal. Maeve’s chest tightened. How was Alexa doing now? Did she think that Maeve was gone forever? What would they be telling the students at Fillmore about her disappearance?

"446","Maeve gripped her covers more tightly. Fillmore. The gunshots, the blood. The suffocating heat of the closet. She’d seen the carnage brilliantly, relentlessly, subconsciously, for weeks that had felt like years. But, finally, for the first time, Maeve allowed herself to remember the other person who had the power to unleash her other side.  She stood up from her bed and turned the old brass knob that protruded from her white door, marked with small pencil-drawn horizontal lines where the very top of her head reached throughout the years. The upstairs landing was dark and murky, but she knew where she wanted to go. Avoiding the small patch of the floor that always creaked when tread upon, she turned right and walked a few steps forward before slowly opening another white door.  Behind it was her sister, lying in bed. Perhaps she was talking on the phone, or typing away on her laptop, or listening to music and staring out into space, as she often did. Maybe she’d tell Maeve to get lost, maybe she wouldn’t say anything, or maybe they’d converse about nothing for hours, as they often did. But Quinn was there, far more there than some random boy from chess club or some stupidly vague old woman who seemed to get a rise out of playing with Maeve’s emotions.  She closed her eyes and let the memory linger for a moment longer. She found that she could nearly smell the lilac from her sister’s diffuser. Maeve had always complained to her that it was too strong. How she longed to breathe in that foul air again.

"447","Her heart rate slowed. The television was on downstairs, quietly, but just loud enough to be heard from her sister’s room. Perhaps her father had just come home from work, or perhaps she was little and her mother could not sleep that night.  And how beautiful the night sky was. Maeve walked across the room to look at the stars, which glowed magnificently. In between the suspended white dots hung the moon, yellow and majestic, which shone gentle light through the cloudless night onto her face. She sat on the floor next to the window, marveling at the sky, for an instant that may well have been an eternity.  Footsteps outside the room brought her out of her dream. Maeve opened her eyes in her beige-walled room and heard a clatter where the steps had come from, just outside the door.  Her mouth tasted like stale sleep, and her back still ached.

One unread message, highlighted with bold letters, appeared at the top of the screen. It had appeared around fifteen minutes after she’d fallen asleep. Maeve’s stomach turned as she clicked on it.

Now it was nearly 8:30, and he had said he would be around all night, but… And there was that stupid name again. That afternoon, he had said he wanted to get to know her better. What good was that if she couldn’t even tell him her real name? The more she looked at it, the more it looked like a sore on an otherwise immaculate piece of artwork.  Maeve stood up and walked to the other side of her room, still staring at her laptop. She was going to have to respond to him. It was so easy to talk to Cassius over the chessboard. But the keyboard looked more to Maeve like a minefield than anything else. Was she going to apologize to him for falling asleep? Should she ask him questions? Tell him something true about herself? Make something up? Was the school going to have access to these emails? Was President Dorothy going to find out and move her to a different school? Questions and pitfalls saturated her mind more completely with each passing second.  She turned away from the pull of the laptop and approached her window. Night had fallen since she fell asleep. Crickets chirped softly, and the branches of the dense fir trees that surrounded the facility swayed gently in the brisk autumn wind. Maeve lowered her head to get a better look at the sky.

"451","Above the gently waltzing treeline, her eye was met with a vast sea of black. No speck of white light looked back at her. The warm yellow moon which once showered her in pale light was drowned in tar.  She stepped away from the window, emotion suddenly grabbing her chest. She reached for her backpack, which she had haphazardly tossed across her room some five hours ago. She flipped through its contents and pulled out her journal.  She opened it, looked through her first few uninspired entries, and smiled sadly. She scribbled over her entry from science class and wrote, in careful letters, underneath it: Wednesday, October 19",451,0,1,108,29,0.0925925925925926,0.157407407407407,0.0648148148148148,0.0277777777777778,0.0277777777777778,0.0555555555555556,0.212962962962963,0.0185185185185185,0,0.185185185185185,0.0185185185185185,0.148148148148148,0,0,0.138888888888889,0,0,0.622700488504785,0.000722490026011586,0.000722490026011677,0.000722490026021803,0.372964571339098,0.000722490026021271,0.000722490026027097,0.000722490026023008
"452","Adrift, beside reality ./. President Dorothy turned her head back to Maeve slowly. The old woman gazed through her with much intent, as though President Dorothy was working out a mental puzzle in her mind. Maeve, frozen behind her, felt a familiar electric current rush through her fingertips.  Some moments later, President Dorothy reached her conclusion. The old woman sighed and deliberately removed her wrinkled hand from the door handle. She properly addressed Maeve and spoke authoritatively.

"453","""I’d like you to open this door."" Maeve fixated on the silver handle. It was only a few paces away from her. It was maybe eight inches long, and bent backwards at a steep angle toward its end, presumably to aid with gripping. There was nothing inherently unique about it– Maeve had probably turned thousands of otherwise identical handles throughout her life. But this one seemed to look back at her with the same calculating intent as President Dorothy did.  It was easy, really. Walk forward, turn the handle, sit inside for thirty seconds, and she’d be done. She could see it in her mind clearly. Three year-old children wouldn’t have an issue with what she was doing.  But when she took a decent stride forward, her face was met with a sudden blast of heat. It burrowed underneath her skin and began to boil her from inside. She breathed deeply and wiped a thick layer of sweat from her hands onto the back of her jeans. She held her ground.

"455","""That’s good. Keep breathing."" She wouldn’t let her gaze meet that of her assailant. In fact, she studied a small patch of the blue carpet across the room from her. The more she looked at it, the more she came to realize it was made up of a number of cool colors, with dark forest green patches bleeding into small swirls of royal purple. She traced the colors in her mind, making note of the effect they had on the carpet, as her heart slowly relaxed its way back into her ribcage. After another minute had passed, President Dorothy knelt down beside Maeve. She moved in close to her and whispered quietly, as though she were revealing some important secret. ""I know this may not be how you see things now, but you have already come so far.

"456","Initially, Maeve wanted to laugh. Important. That word had been thrown around so much recently that she had started to forget its meaning. Wasn’t she supposed to be leading some army? That seemed important. But none of these lessons were about battle strategy, or killing, or blood sacrifices, as Maeve had idly predicted upon her first encounter with President Dorothy. They were just walking toward a stupid closet.  And it was somewhat amusing to her that the old woman was self-aware enough to know that she was such a loathsome figure in her life. Although Maeve still resented her father, was President Dorothy not the central figure in the death of Jason? Most of the time, Maeve did hate her. Not just during lessons.  But at that moment, as though it were reflex, she sat up and gave President Dorothy a hug. She only latched on to this wicked, controlling, intelligent, caring woman for a moment. She knew what happened in this room, and on the flight, and in the closet. No one else did.  Maeve sat back down, somewhat shocked at what had happened. It was as though she had lost and then regained all sense of bodily autonomy. For the first time since she had stepped into the janitorial closet, she looked at President Dorothy.

In some sense, she was successful– the blaring stopped, replaced by a dull ringing in her ears.  But alas, during her follow-through, she knocked her biology folder directly on the ground. The gentle splat of the papers on the ground told her all that she needed to know.  Maeve mumbled under her breath as she swung her legs over the side of the bed.

Though it was still dark, and though she was contending with a mild case of frustration over the spilled schoolwork, she managed to choose something tasteful for the upcoming day.  She made her way into the bathroom and started the shower. As the water warmed up, she hunted for papers across the room. A multiple choice quiz about the classification of mammals was caught against the radiator. She shuddered as she filed that one away. Thank goodness she was many weeks removed from that unit. Cassius had told her that Mrs. Phelps had left the answer key to that quiz on her desk during lunch, so most of her class had been able to cheat on the exam. Not her, though. She had to fight tooth and nail for the eighty-five she got, all because no one could– or would, probably– text her the picture.

"461","The assignment was a slog. She had to carefully label and describe cellular respiration, a process which was completely uninteresting to Maeve. Fortunately, she spent most of the night emailing Cassius, who had been of some help and of massive distraction.  She braced herself to move her bed back into position. Although she hadn’t moved it far– a few feet, if that– it was much heavier than she’d imagined, and at any rate she still wasn’t fully awake. But before she went to push, a devious plan laid itself out before her, as though laid out by divine revelation. In its current position, the bed was almost up against the door. Just above the door, and definitely reachable if she were to stand on the foot of the bed, was the camera.  She absentmindedly tore off a small scrap of page from the bottom corner of her assignment.

Though she had no idea what the camera was looking for, and though President Dorothy nor Elyse had ever mentioned it specifically, the idea of taping it shut twinged something inside of her. The allure of a moment of privacy. Or perhaps of something else.  Either way, she reached for her tape and carefully balanced at the foot of her bed.

"464","The young woman reciprocated Elyse’s smile and opened the car door. She was immediately met with a blast of cold air and the piercing sting of whipping snowflakes cutting across her cheek. As she did often, Bess wondered in amazement how Elyse could be so cheerful on such a cold, dark, early morning.  She navigated past a patch of concrete that always seemed to ice over on snowy days like today, and made her way into the school. There were still fifteen minutes or so before first period officially began, so the hallways were still sparsely populated. Bess walked quickly past walls of ancient trophies displayed proudly behind glass cases and turned into the cafeteria.  Above her head, the school’s giant red homecoming banner hung proudly despite the fact that it had been several weeks since it had been relevant. Although it was early, trash had still managed to find its way onto most of the empty tables. And fortunately enough, Cassius and his group of six or seven other boys were already at their usual table, talking loudly and laughing.  Bess stealthily made her way over to the mess of boys and noticed that Cassius was in the middle of telling a story. She tugged on his coat sleeve from behind. He didn’t react. She tried again. The eyes of most of the boys gathered around the table turned to her, but even then, Cassius kept on talking. Frustrated now, Maeve wrapped both of her arms around him and started unzipping his coat from the front.

"465","""Jesus, woman, what do you want?"" he yelled without turning to look at her, previously mid-sentence. Bess and the whole rest of the table erupted into laughter.  He slid over to make room for her, and she sat next to him. After giving her a quick glance to ensure that it was indeed Bess that he had been addressing, he continued his story almost without missing a beat.  ""So I’m on the game with Jacob last night, right? And we load into the lobby with two other guys, and we are dead even. I mean, for fifteen minutes I think us and them were within two or three kills of each other. I don’t think I have ever tried so hard at anything before in my life.

""But they’re still killing me, right? So we’re up one with like fifteen seconds left. And Jacob says this into the mic– so deadpan serious– ‘If you sell, C, I will never forgive you.’ And I start dying laughing, but I mean, I don’t want to lose the game for him. So I hide behind a wall, and watch the seconds count down. Five, four, three…"" Cassius stuck his pointer and middle finger out to mimic a gun, and pressed them against his head.  ""Bang. I’m dead. No idea how. I must have been peeking out from the side. I never heard anyone coming, either. I just got sniped. After my heart attack was over, I slammed the controller on the ground, and may have said a word that I was not supposed to. And downstairs, I hear this huge crash. I guess I must have scared my mom or something, because she yells back up at me, ‘Cassius Minor, you need to control yourself!’ And then my dad yells at me and my mom to stop yelling, and then they’re fighting again. Anyway– long story short– my mom says she’s going to Florida, and she slams the door and leaves. And then my dad yells up to me that he’s going to the place that’s farthest away from Florida.

They’re both gonna take next week off from work and go to separate places. My dad said he’d be back on Saturday night and my mom said she’d be back Sunday morning.

Beyond that, though, there was the small problem that  ""You know I can’t do Fridays!"" said Bess, standing up to leave.  ""I know, but, can you… see if you can get it moved, or something?

She reached over the dentist-style chair she was currently seated in and slid it into her backpack, and resumed waiting.  This was actually the first time Maeve had sat in this chair. Each week, she had passed it on her way to the janitorial closet, and it had loomed, isolated, menacing, as though it were some sort of invisible barrier that demarcated the boundary between the comfortable side of the room and the uninhabitable side. The black television stood watch above the room, as grimly as ever. She could only make out her reflection on the screen when she was near the closet. But today, President Dorothy had told her to sit in the chair and wait. She had spent some time studying the small metal table next to the left armrest, and the adjustable headlight that was suspended over her like a dismembered arm. She recalled vividly her painful and uncomfortable trips to the dentist, which always seemed to end ominously, as some twisted bonus. When she was younger, her dentist would mention something about cavities, or flossing more, or wisdom tooth surgery, and she would come home in unconsolable tears.

"493","Room 135 was significantly smaller than its next door neighbor. In fact, had Maeve not known where she was, she’d have been fairly confident this was a room in the hospital where her grandmother had stayed in the weeks following her back surgery. An IV bag and some kind of monitor flanked a hospital bed which sat parallel to the wall that connected the room to the hallway. A small table which featured a vase of flowers was positioned in front of the monitor near the entrance. Across the room, perhaps eight or ten feet from the doorway, was a large opaque curtain.  It was not until Maeve had stepped into the room that she noticed the man was sitting on a chair. He must have been extraordinarily tall when he was standing, but instead of walking, he rolled around on an adjustable chair with noisy wheels on the bottom.  But Maeve was not necessarily concerned with the man. As she took in her surroundings and jumped up slightly to sit on the bed, she attempted to piece together what exactly was about to happen to her.  Hospital. I’m in a hospital. What do they do in hospitals? Surgery. My God they’re        going to do surgery.

"505","All of Maeve’s thoughts and memories seemed to slosh together like laundry in a washing machine. Her whole body, from the top of her head to the tips of her toes, was filled with a glowing, buzzing warmth like she had never felt before. She knew for sure that she could not have sat up, even if she wanted to. Her body must have weighed a thousand pounds.  ""Next question, dear,"" said President Dorothy, quickly pacing back to her position at the foot of the bed. ""What has been bothering you lately?"" Maeve tried to assemble the words that the old woman had said as though they were pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Once the question made sense to her, there was the issue of answering it. A distant voice miles beneath her skin tried to relay a message to her muddled brain, but she ignored it and said the first tattered idea that came to her.  ""Cassius…I think he likes me…and I like him…"" here she had to overcome a giggling fit– ""do you know what’s the prob– problem with that?

""Now, I have to ask– what do you think of me?"" Upon hearing this question, Maeve made a stunning realization– she had been asked these questions before! Unfortunately, she could not remember what she said last time. Beyond that, she felt herself more and more inclined to stop answering the questions and take a quick nap right then and there on the bed.

"509","She extended her hand out a few inches from her face, and she could only just make out the faint outline of her fingers from the all-encompassing blackness.  This is odd, she thought. Most nights, she left her blinds open so that some hint of moonlight could trickle into the room.  She was hot, too. Uncomfortably so. As she regained her senses, she felt more and more the dryness of her mouth and the thin layer of sweat that stuck to her skin under…the two layers of shirts and the jacket she’d worn to school earlier.  Maeve sat up in bed and took off the jacket. Had she really passed out wearing all of her school clothes? She tried to think back.

"510","And then what? Suddenly feeling a bit unsettled, Maeve stood up. Her eyes were adjusting to the dark, and they told her that she was, indeed, still in her room. Her sense of balance, however, was faulty. As soon as she had put two feet on the ground, she had to cling on to the dresser to make sure that she didn’t fall over.  As she reached for it, she felt a peculiar tightness in the crook of her right arm, underneath her elbow. She knew what it was instantly. A band-aid. And suddenly, confusing and contradictory memories started to come back to her.  She’d been called back downstairs. Elyse had looked particularly worried. And then…the masked man had stuck the needle in her arm. Everything after that was very hazy. She was somewhat certain that President Dorothy had been there…or, perhaps, she had imagined her.  Her thinking would have to wait, however. She needed water. Maeve clumsily sauntered across the dark room until she reached the window.

"511","But that didn’t matter. Now she could see her way to the bathroom. She tried once more to walk without holding onto the walls, but it was nearly impossible. She felt as though she'd just been spun around on one of the cheap fair rides that her sister used to take her on when she was little.  Hands still planted on the walls, Maeve finally reached the sink. She threw on the cold water and brought handfuls of water to her mouth, spilling some back into the sink but most onto the floor. Nothing had ever tasted so divine to her. She tossed her hair back and drank directly from the faucet. When she’d had enough, she wiped her face and reached for the bathroom light.

"512","She almost shouted in terror. She was so, so frighteningly pale. Her skin would have closely matched the whites of her eyes had they not been so bloodshot. Even the color in her lips seemed to be a sickly shade of pink.  Maeve studied her face. In any other circumstance, she would have sworn it was not hers. It was the face of someone much older, much more tired, much more sickly than her. It had to be. Yet here it was, studying her just as she studied it.  Feeling somewhat more stable on her feet, Maeve made her way back to bed and opened her laptop, which was nearly dead. (As it happened, it was nearly 3:30 in the morning.) When she typed in her password, Cassius’ message was still up on the screen.  Reading the line once more, she felt a wave of rage surge through her body.

"513","In fact– she chuckled ruefully– she could have said anything before she had fallen asleep. Maybe she told too much of the truth. Maybe she made something up. She could be in new levels of trouble altogether. In fact, she thought, there’s a nonzero chance that someone’s coming to put a bullet in my head right now, just like they did to Jason. Maybe some other kid from across the country is better at communicating while under the influence.  But then why would they have let her wake up at all? Maeve massaged her temples. It hurt to think, and it hurt even more so when it was about what President Dorothy was going to do to her as a result of today.  At any rate, she concluded, she would probably not have woken up alone in her room on the brink of dehydration if she was in the good graces of her captors.

With heavy eyelids, she checked the solid red digits of the clock on her nightstand.  10:18 PM. She couldn’t quite make out what was being said downstairs, but she was sure that it involved a lot of what must have been either shouting or crying. Under ordinary circumstances, the commotion would have been rather concerning, but Maeve was relatively sure she knew it had something to do with the play she’d just been to.  It was very long and confusing. Maeve knew that her sister was the lead, and she was very impressed by the fact that Quinn had managed to remember so many lines perfectly. But by the time intermission had ended, she had grown quite uncomfortable in her chair, and frankly a bit sick and tired of the way the big kids were always singing about everything all of the time.

"516","At first, sleep seemed impossibly far away. She squirmed and wriggled in the oversized auditorium chair in pursuit of the perfect position, but there was always something wrong. Her hand would start to fall asleep, or her neck would be bent at an odd angle. Finally, her father reached over and rubbed her shoulder. ""Maeve, honey, sit still. The show’s almost over."" Reluctantly, she resumed an upright position and returned her gaze to the stage. There was her sister, lying on the ground, in the grasp of some muscular bearded man who looked just as old as her third-grade teacher.  Maeve knew what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, she didn’t have enough time to look away. The bearded grown-up put his mouth all over Quinn’s mouth, right there in front of the whole audience!

"517","Maeve thought she was going to be sick. It sounded like Quinn was going to be sick, too. She was down on the ground for a while, and then she started calling for help. But when the lights turned back on and some other grown-ups ran onto the stage, she told them not to touch her, but with an extra word that Maeve did not recognize. Eventually, though, she stood up and ran off the stage, so Maeve had thought that everything was alright.  Her parents weren’t acting normal, though. When Quinn ran off of the stage, her mother grabbed her arm and ran out of the auditorium. The Harpers spent the next few minutes asking everyone and anyone if they had seen their daughter. Although she’d mostly grown out of them, Maeve could still remember how she felt during her meltdowns. She would kick and scream and shout because nothing made her more unhappy than when something was unfair, and life seemed to be so unfair all the time. But it seemed as though mommy and daddy were having meltdowns together, at the same time, even though they were grown-ups. She didn’t usually see grown-ups have meltdowns.  Thanks to the help of a thin boy who was dressed entirely in black, the Harpers eventually found Quinn. She had locked herself in a practice room, still in her princess costume, and she was looking out the window. She didn’t want to come out at first, but she eventually unlocked the door when she made them promise that they would take her straight home.  The ride home was very quiet. All Maeve could remember was that the low hum of the car driving on backroads combined with the darkness of the spring night and the cool air from the vent was nearly enough to put her to sleep. Unfortunately, they arrived back home just as she was nodding off. She reluctantly allowed her father to pick her up and carry her into her room.",517,0,-1,340,36,0.0558823529411765,0.0941176470588235,0.102941176470588,0.0735294117647059,0.0470588235294118,0.0823529411764706,0.152941176470588,0,0.0323529411764706,0.138235294117647,0.0205882352941176,0.117647058823529,0.0352941176470588,0,0.164705882352941,0,0,0.258946969649895,0.000352162919624996,0.000352162919628576,0.000352162919625862,0.0003521629196287,0.000352162919626324,0.000352162919625618,0.738940052832345
"518","That was when the shouting started. Now, more awake than ever, she felt curious to know exactly what was happening downstairs.  She turned on the light and took a tenuous step out of bed.  The muffled noise from downstairs made the cold floor vibrate ever so slightly on Maeve’s feet. She felt very grown-up, walking around at this hour. Sometimes, as she was falling asleep, she would hear her father gently making his way around the house. On some school nights, she would be sent to bed before he got home from work, and she’d wake up the next morning after he left. It was a great mystery to her what her father did those nights. At any rate, she knew for sure that no one else from her class was allowed to be up this late, especially on a Sunday night. The excitement made her heart pound. She reached for the doorknob and twisted it open. The commotion turned into words, which Maeve could only just make out.

"519","""...caused it, I mean… anything…"" ""No! No… Mom, I’m telling you, it just happened!""  Quinn was hysterical. She spoke through uneven breaths, as though she was trying her hardest to stop from crying.  Quinn wasn’t supposed to be having a meltdown; she was practically a grown-up herself. Something must have gone seriously wrong. Maeve made her way silently to the upstairs landing in an attempt to hear the quieter words of her parents.

"537","And gigantic, it was. Stuck in a neighborhood of homes that seemed to be on par with Bess’ own across the country, Cassius’ house, complete with a sprawling lawn, three stories’ worth of massive, ornate windows, and a sprawling, slanting roof, was a mini-mansion.  As much as she wanted to stop and marvel at the house, Bess was eager  enough to be inside that she hurried quickly to the front door along with Ben, Amy, and Jacob. Jacob pulled a glove off of his right hand and banged on the oversized polished wooden door.  Almost immediately, a random man opened the door and let them inside. Bess, the last of the four to enter, could hardly believe the scene she witnessed.  Humanity piled more closely and more intensely than she had ever thought possible. The room she was standing in, less of a living room and more of a foyer, felt as cramped as though she were standing in an outhouse bathroom. It didn’t smell much better, either. People, some she recognized as fellow high school students, and some she didn’t, were dancing either with, on, or completely separate from each other. The music was so loud that Bess’ skull seemed to be vibrating. It took her serious effort to put thoughts together over the assaulting noise. The floor was covered with a thick white carpet which Bess could already see was stained in multiple places, and every so often Bess thought that she could hear a loud crash or a shout over everything.

She looked back to the sea of people. Everyone she had come with was instantly gone, like pool balls broken by an expert player. She stood on her tiptoes to look for her friends, and began to feel a dreadful panic. There was no way she would be able to spot anyone in this crowd. Bess resolved to at least make her way upstairs. Perhaps if she could find a room which was less than packed to the brim with people, she could think about what to do next. The wide stairway was just on the other side of the foyer.  She awkwardly made her way forward. She tried not to concentrate on how many people she had to touch to move through the crowd. Instead, she tried to mentally  describe the quality of the air as though she was writing in her journal.

She was looking for a bathroom, but every door seemed to be closed tightly, and she didn’t want to find out what was going on behind any of them, especially if they were not bathrooms.  By the time she reached the map, she had become certain that her lot in life was to be stuck there, in the midst of all of these hundreds of people, holding this random red solo cup, for the rest of time. She looked at it sadly. Pins stuck out of New York, Dallas, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Orlando, Memphis, and Denver. None in New Jersey, though.

Cassius’ face, which had just been quite flushed with color, turned a ghostly shade of white, and his eyes looked miles past her. With a sinking feeling, Bess turned around.

"574","Suit, after suit. They passed room after room, shaking and talking and swooning over her. 127, 129, 131. If nothing else, she thought she knew where the line would stop.  And of course, she did. She met with the last man, balding, hoarse, elderly, next to room 137. Through the unceasing round of applause, and through whatever stare her father may have been giving to her, she stepped inside.  President Dorothy, and five doctors in suits, were all gathered around the chair in the center of the main room. Protruding from the corner of the room was an old widescreen television across the room that was perched on top of a small table with wheels. Redundant, perhaps, she thought. The screen that had been on top of the chair ever since she’d arrived at the facility was still keeping vigil over the storage closet in the corner of the room. Perhaps it was never meant to be used at all.  The chair was surrounded by a host of other machines, some large and some small, that Maeve could not recognize. Some flashed, some made noise, all of them tracked, moved, breathed. In unnerving contrast with the rows of people outside, the doctors looked at her blankly, with strained, anxious eyes.

"575","President Dorothy gestured for her to take a seat, but Maeve was already walking over to do so. Her skin glowed bright white, enough even to be seen outside the room.  She sat down, and the doctors sprung instantly into action. One taped a small monitor to her temple, and another clipped a heartbeat sensor to her finger. A third intently read an output of one of the machines, and the remaining two wrote furiously on legal notepads.  President Dorothy monitored the chaos for a brief moment, and then stepped to tower over Maeve, much like she had done the previous week.  ""This is an important night, Maeve.

It would be foolish, then, to deny you your rightful position any longer.""  President Dorothy motioned over to the doctor who had been positioned behind the machines. He wheeled the television slowly in front of the chair. In another existence she watched old documentaries on these types of sets in elementary school.  Wordlessly, he powered on the television, spurring an intense flurry of static that washed over the screen. The noise was relentless and monotone, whooshing to nowhere in particular.  He reached behind the television to manufacture a syringe, and delicately grabbed it with a gloved hand. He set it to rest in President Dorothy’s wrinkled palm.

The old woman took Maeve’s right arm and expertly inserted the needle into one of her veins. Before she could even feel a pinch, it was over. There would be no struggling.

"580","Heart thumping, her eyes darted between President Dorothy and the doctors. Everyone here was doing a job. She was in a horror movie. As was the case last Friday, it was not long before Maeve began to feel odd. This time, however, she felt very light, particularly in her head. She settled on watching the television screen. The static seemed to warp and twist into strange patterns, the noise blending together with her very own thoughts and feelings. The room dove and turned away from her, and she felt as though she was going to fall directly out of her chair.  Something impossible happened. She became so light that she floated, gently, gracefully, out of the room, and into her cavernous mind. Everywhere she looked, she saw flashes of white and black, designing intricate patterns, only to please her. She heard grass swishing, bells chiming, rain pattering. She smelled a campfire, she felt the sun on her skin, she was full, hungry, dry, tired, alert, content, agitated.  She swam through the static and found herself, as clearly as though she was watching a movie in a theater. She was chasing after something on hard, dry ground. She wanted to catch it so badly.

She’d find shelter or she’d die trying.  Another version. She was angry. She was so angry. There was lots of motion around her, and everything was bigger than she was. She was so confused.

She wasn’t angry anymore. In fact, she wasn’t full or hungry or cold or tired at all.  But she could still see what she’d just been about to do. She was in a city, and a flood of people were crossing a street. She was much smaller than all of them, and she had been just about to try to kill one of them.  But– that wasn’t her anymore. Instead, she watched what was formerly herself stop dead in its tracks mid-jump. In fact, she could see all of the past versions of herself stop dead. Alternate versions, too.

She fixed the instrument directly at the spot atop the television, and with a small click purple light beamed across the room.  The pain was instant and overwhelming. Maeve felt it everywhere, but most so in her lungs, which felt as though they contained molten lava instead of air. She convulsed directly out of her chair, and did not scream so much as whimper, as screaming would have taken far too much breath.  It ended just as suddenly as it had begun. Maeve’s left cheek was on the floor, and every muscle in her body was tense, but there was no more pain. Instead, President Dorothy crouched beside her, and ran a gentle hand through her hair.

"593","President Dorothy stiffened. ""We like to look for young people to take over when another Leader abdicates. We believe through the course of their lives, young leaders can make more worthwhile connections to dreamers. However, this introduces risk. Many young Leaders throughout history have revealed themselves to be woefully unfit to perform their duty. War, disease, hysteria– left unchecked, or under the control of a vulnerable Leader, dreamers have the power to infiltrate and corrupt the bodies and minds of the public, while remaining completely undetected in doing so. These dreamers are always going to want to inspire tragedy– it is what they are. Under the right Leader, however, this can be managed, and even used as a force for good. A good Leader has sharp emotional acuity. A good Leader thinks for themself, but is always willing to listen and collaborate. A good Leader is intelligent and charismatic. A good Leader is not afraid to do what must be done."" President Dorothy sighed. ""Your father nominated you, personally, when we decided that the previous Leader was to be replaced. In all of my experience, I could never recall one of my employees nominating a family member for Leader. But he was insistent that you had all of the qualities we were looking for. So my colleagues and myself spent several months observing you and a handful of other candidates, and you won out. Now, after teaching you personally for the last three months, I am confident we made the correct decision."" Maeve shook her head. ""I still don’t understand.""

In between pieces, she pounded her fist on the old door, more and more sure that no one was behind it at all.  When she had plucked the last piece free, she ripped off the coat she’d been wearing and wrapped it as tightly as she could around her injured arm. A new wave of pain told her that she’d probably missed a shard or two.  Quinn leaned against the door and gave it one final slam. With a choked sob, she slid down until she was sitting with her back facing the wall. How stupid she had been.  She let her head hit the door, and closed her eyes. It was over.

"634","With hands shaking, she threw herself into her car. Blood soaked through her heavy coat and stained the seat.  She laid on the horn of her car. The noise was enough to disturb some birds who had taken an early nest in some of the neighboring trees. She had no breath left to yell; this would have to do.  But as she sat there and honked and bled and cried, her thoughts became much louder than anything else. All this way, she thought, all this way for a fucking prank. How did Ty manage to make those videos? I was sure- sure!- it was them. He must have been texting me the whole time, too. And now I’m fucking alone in the middle of nowhere with this guy. I’m so stupid. So stupid. I deserve whatever’s about to happen to me. The horn was not going to elicit a response. Quinn eventually turned her attention from signaling to Ty to her mangled left arm. Gingerly, though through stifled cries of betrayal, loss, and self-admonishment, she removed her coat. It had once been a dark-green, but it was now covered in sweeping, brown splotches. With her right hand, she swept through the glove compartment. She put one in her own car when she’d purchased it years ago.

"635","After an aggravating moment of digging through paperwork, tissues, and perhaps more fast food wrappers from the last two days than she’d have liked to admit, she miraculously felt a plastic box, and pulled it out with such vigor that she spilled much of the contents of the glove box onto the passenger side floor.  She unwound the small roll of medical tape and spun it clumsily around her left arm. Although it was tight and piercingly hot, it stemmed the vast majority of the bleeding.  As she looked over her work, Quinn unmistakably heard a tapping on her window.  She turned to see a short woman who could not have been much older than she was. Even though that early March morning was cold, her face looked much paler than it should have been. Quinn’s initial surprise at seeing her was quickly washed away by strange notes of sympathy.

Looking upward, she saw before her a well-dressed old woman.  It clicked before she even had time to understand what clicked. Quinn brought herself to her feet, and before either of them had time to say a word, she threw the old woman to the ground. She looked even older in person than she did on the VHS recordings. With a loud crash, she landed on her back just in front of the solitary chair, and one of the items she’d been holding– a box that looked more than anything like an empty cage that may have been for holding cats– skittered halfway across the room. A small groan escaped the woman’s dry lips as she hit the carpeted ground.  Quinn was so hysterical that she couldn’t see straight.

Quinn hesitated only for a brief moment before she followed, moving by what was left of her survival instinct rather than by conscious choice.  As she exited room 137 and saw carpet turn into tile, a single sob escaped from her lips. Grief and apathy and hatred all fought for dominance in her mind, but all were conquered by the relentless visual of those last moments in the janitorial closet.  They climbed three flights of stairs and turned into a large room that was stunningly white. President Dorothy ordered her to sit down on the floor in front of a large horizontally-oriented pipe that was perhaps a foot off of the ground, and painted white just the same as everything else in the room. When Quinn had done so, the old woman procured a pair of handcuffs from the inside of her coat pocket and chained her wrists to the pipe.  Quinn did not resist. She did not say a word.

"658","Thoughts and feelings echoed throughout her mind at a dizzying pace. They were so vivid that although she was blindfolded, she could have sworn she was seeing– vast fields, the interior of homes, scenes from memories that oddly may not even have been hers. Smells, sounds, even tastes hung on the outer edge of her perception, as though misplaced in reality.  Beyond the dreadful buzzing, she was stoic. She did not rattle her cuffs; she did not cry for help; she did not fight to remove the handkerchief. Her grief had, for the moment, stolen her resolve to do any of these things. The only thing she wanted was to wake up.  Minutes passed. Maeve is gone. The words looped through her conscious mind without end, but they still seemed to lack concrete meaning. There was no way they could be true– but they always had been, until just a few days ago. She was gone then, just as she was now. Accepting that fact felt akin to letting the devil himself into her already mangled thoughts.  The physical sensations did not fade. If anything, she began to feel as though she was being watched. If she tried, she thought she could almost imagine the room she was in in perfect detail, despite the fact that she hadn’t paid attention to it at all when she’d walked in.

"659","Finally, Quinn heard a door open. It sounded as though something heavy was being dragged by someone who was exerting a lot of effort. She thought about speaking up, but simply collecting the air into her lungs felt a monumental task.  The dragging stopped in a corner of the room across from her. The lump was propped up and facing her, and had its back against the large mirror that encompassed the entire wall, just like it had been on the VHS tape (how did she know this? Instinct, maybe? She couldn’t see a thing.). She heard a sigh, a jingle and click, and then the crescendo of quick footsteps.  As cold hands removed her blindfold, a booming voice rang out over the same PA system she had listened to in the hotel two nights ago.

"660","The harsh white light of the room was unkind to Quinn’s eyes at first. She instinctively went to cover her face with her hand, but was stopped short by the rattle of the handcuffs’ chain against the pipe.  But after she had blinked a few times, her breath caught in her throat. The lump was Ty, dressed in a baggy gray sweatshirt and even paler than he was when he had vanished earlier. He lay unconscious on his side, and his chained left arm hung grotesquely from a door handle just next to the edge of the mirror.  Quinn pulled with all of her might against her own restraints, and saw that the young woman was the one who had removed her blindfold. As she shouted her voice cracked from stress.

Although the sun shone through the second floor windows, a luxury she did not have during the colder winter months, she had still struggled to wake herself up.  She opened the door at the far end of the hallway, and took off her heavy backpack. It hit the ground with a dull thud. Massaging her shoulders, she found a seat in the middle of the large wooden table that ran lengthwise across the room.  ""Eggs again?"" she asked, having removed the silver dish in front of her. The same meal as yesterday sat before her: two scrambled eggs, two pieces of bacon, some lightly burned toast, and a cup of orange juice. It had seemed to her months ago a rather high-end breakfast– usually on school mornings at home, she would pour a bowl of cereal for herself, if anything at all. Now she was almost repulsed by what she saw.  Elyse frowned from across the table. ""President Dorothy told the kitchen that you should have some protein before this afternoon.

And we cried, and hugged him, and he hugged us too. ""But he wasn’t really himself anymore. He was erratic, manic; he kept weird hours and did weird things. He would spend days alone in his room, talking to himself, and then go for jogs around the neighborhood that lasted for hours. Sometimes he would scream at me, or my cousin, or the dog we had. He even flipped a table once during dinner. It was like– he was there, but not really. I mean, he was seven years older than me, and he was annoying sometimes, but I never hated him. From the day he got back, I found myself wishing he hadn’t.

"704","""A few years later, he went away to college. For three months, everyone in my house took a collective deep breath. But when he got back for winter break, he… looked rough. His eyes were sunken into his skull. He barely spoke or ate. I was worried, but– I was eleven. I was just a kid, I didn’t know what to say to him.  ""That first night, I couldn’t sleep. It must have been 2:30 or so, and I heard the front door open downstairs. I just knew it was him. So, against my better judgment, I got out of bed and went outside. I was calling his name so loud I must have woken up everyone else in the neighborhood. And I didn’t even know if I wanted to find him.  ""As it turned out, he didn’t get far. There was a light on in the tiny shed behind our house. It was made of this really old, flimsy wood, so I could hear him mumbling before I even went in. I was so scared to open the door. But I did. And… he was in there, on the ground, taking these big, deep breaths, and talking nonsense. And next to him was our dog. It was just frozen there, not breathing, nothing. There was no evidence of any struggle, no blood. It was just dead. And before I had time to scream, or run away, Ryan shot up, put a hand over my mouth, and dragged me into that black car. We drove east for ten straight hours. And when we finally stopped, it was in this parking lot, here.  ""Ryan explained to President Dorothy what had happened. She brought some other kid into the building, and I never saw Ryan again. But she kept me around. She told me I owed my life to her, and if I ever disobeyed her or told another soul what had happened, she’d go after my family too. That was…fourteen years ago.""",704,0,-14,338,43,0.0591715976331361,0.0857988165680473,0.118343195266272,0.0798816568047337,0.0562130177514793,0.0591715976331361,0.130177514792899,0.0118343195266272,0.0207100591715976,0.20414201183432,0.014792899408284,0.201183431952663,0.0118343195266272,0,0.144970414201183,0,0,0.823648915342444,0.000380533896613818,0.000380533896609789,0.000380533896612966,0.174067881277882,0.000380533896611521,0.000380533896612416,0.000380533896613048

"721","A small animal, perhaps only the size of a housecat, galloped into the room. Beside the fact that it moved on four legs, however, it looked unlike any cat she’d seen before. Its skin was a shade of purplish blue, and knotted flakes of it protruded off of its fleshy body, so that it looked to Quinn as though it would feel sharp to the touch. Its face was something like an owl’s, with a long, extended beak, but its eyes were completely white, so that it was impossible to tell exactly where it was looking. Its feet, which were more like talons than anything else, seemed almost to hover above the ground where it stood.  Quinn, frozen, watched the thing gracefully navigate the room. It was like nothing she had seen before, except perhaps in a nightmare. It seemed impossible that an animal like this could be real.  It stopped in the center of the room, equidistant from herself and Ty. It turned its long neck to Quinn and shone its milky white eyes at her.  She pressed herself against the wall and opened her mouth. It backed up a step and opened its beaked mouth as well, revealing row upon row of tiny, jagged teeth.

And somewhere, through the haze of color that was the inside of her eyelids and the racing thoughts of her mind, she found it. She could see herself, chained, concentrating, from across the room.

"760","Even if she had, though, she would have still endured this great surge of panic, which seemed to course through her veins as freely as her own blood. It shook her, this feeling. She was not often one to lose control of her feelings in this way. The cause of her overwhelming concern was not necessarily the prospect that a Leader may pass on without a proper plan in place for succession– she had dealt with precarious situations of that manner before, and always she’d managed to procure some improvised plan– but it was something else entirely. In all of her years, she hadn’t felt such responsibility for another human being. All of her work with Maeve had transitioned, seamlessly, perhaps even more powerfully than before, over to an older, stronger, version of herself.  The eye of the storm of panic she felt was a poisonously alluring thought that won over everything else in the old woman’s mind. Perhaps the years of pain and failure could come to an end. Perhaps this is the one. Perhaps our plan will work as it was once intended to after all.  Regardless of the risk, the opportunity simply could not be wasted.

She was nearly halfway through an essay in which she’d been forced to analyze the actions of one Mr. Robinson, or Mr. Richardson, or something to that effect. She could never remember the man’s name. The book was just too dense. As she was not allowed a computer, she had spent the past two and a half hours writing and erasing on pages of loose leaf paper. She had just thought of the word unconscionable and that seemed to signal to her that she needed a break.  Outside of her room, footsteps came and went. On some evenings, the chatter she could overhear was quite alarming (perhaps in subject matter, or volume, or both), but today it was three older women recalling a canceled television show here, two men debating about sports there. The heat from outside seemed to have a mellowing effect on her peers. It was mellowing her out, too. On a hot day like this, the air conditioner seemed just enough to drown out the noise in her head.

"820","Hey Quinn, I guess this is goodbye. The way things have been going, I think they’re going to kill me. I have no idea whether or not you’re in on the whole secret organization/psychic superpower thing like Dad is (has been for years, as it turns out), but something about the look on your face as we drove away on the day of the shooting tells me you aren’t. If that’s the case, and if what I’ve been hearing is true, then I imagine that you’re probably scared and maybe a little bit sad that I’m gone (depending on how you really felt about me, behind all those layers of callous indifference that the years have bestowed so kindly upon your demeanor). But, assuming I can find some way to get this to you, right now I need you. Before I say anything sappy, and I’ll get to all that, I need you to know that something else is going on. I’m almost positive they’ll find some way to give you whatever it is that they gave me. And I’m so sorry it has to be that way. If you feel, underneath everything else, more perceptive, or more imaginative (?), or more out of tune with how you think you should be feeling– then you know you have it. President Dorothy told me an old professor of hers discovered these things– dreamers, they call them– that exist in some metaphysical realm parallel to ours. I can’t explain it; there was a lot of math involved, and you know I’m hopeless with that kind of thing. They seem to be fascinated with killing and traumatizing humans, though, and I guess that as they were unchecked for the entire course of human history, they have been responsible for probably thousands or millions of deaths. They don’t feed, they don’t really reproduce, but they just– kill. It drives them, or something. And they’re smart about it, too. If they don’t have to, they won’t leave any evidence behind. Other people will just think it was a heart attack or a stroke or something. They’re untraceable. Scary shit.  President Dorothy has been working with psychologists and doctors and theoretical physicists (and fifteen-year-olds, I guess) to try and link a human to the hive mind that the dreamers seem to share. Miraculously, they figured it out. It’s unbelievable– but, if you have it now, you already know that. The dreamers have been begging me to kill for weeks. Constantly. I’ve been telling them no, and they listen to me, but it takes every ounce of my energy to resist. The doctors here gave me a dose of something crazy once, and that helped. But I really would rather not go down that road. I mean, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I want that feeling just as bad as I want to give into the dreamers. And I only had one dose.  None of that matters anymore to me, I suppose. I don’t know what they’re going to do to you. The six months or so I’ve spent here have been scary and shitty and above anything else lonely, but they kept telling me I was going to be able to leave at some point. And I do believe them. Had I killed some poor soul in front of the scientists, or even a dog, or something, I think they would have let me go. I don’t think they were convinced I had enough control over the dreamers to do something like that. God knows I did. I just didn’t want to kill the first time, because I know I wouldn’t have ever been able to stop.

You’re probably going to feel terrible, all the time, but there’s no one on the planet that is capable of saving more lives than you. That’s what President Dorothy told me, at least, every time I failed one of her dumb tests. Ironic, I guess.  No matter what, you’re my superhero. The earliest I can remember, you were eleven and I was probably four. You came back from the dentist with these metal wires on your teeth, and I immediately started crying because I thought they were scary and probably painful. But you explained what they were, and how they worked, and ten minutes later I was laughing. I don’t know how much I told you this, really, but I’ve never stopped thinking of you like that. You do the hard things, and then I come home seven years later with braces, and I’m okay because I know you got through it. And you drive me to concerts. And you sneak me and my friends onto mini golf courses.  So I guess it’s alright that things worked out this way, because maybe for once I can help you out with something.

"822","The girl in the dark black dress with the dark black hair stood at the front of the line, absorbing their words and shaking their cold, clammy hands. She was quite tall and gaunt, with high cheekbones and narrow shoulders and beady brown eyes that looked through, rather than at. Some of the people in attendance that day thought (to themselves, of course, no one would dare to say it out loud) that she was an even more harrowing sight than that of her poor father, embalmed and puffed up in his polished burgundy casket, still bearing signs of the relentless cancer that had taken him so suddenly, at the age of forty-one. Even still, perhaps in different lighting, or with a bit of make-up, his daughter may have been beautiful.  Next in line was her great-uncle, a loud man who drank and swore too much. Though she rarely saw him, he had taken a liking to sitting her down and giving her long one-on-one lectures about her impending life and career as a woman, as though she were his own child. He would announce to all present at Easter brunches or family barbecues that he was ""gettin’ my dear-old grandniece to say somethin’, for a change!"" before talking over her in a cramped attic or washroom for twenty minutes that felt like hours. He always stank such that she could not pay attention to him.  She hated him. But more crucially, she found him to be unimpressive.  He hugged her mother and lamented into her ear, lines of spittle lingering on his lips as he spoke. They both cried, their faces red, splotchy, moist. For as ungraceful as they looked, it fit their faces well. Perhaps if it fit her face well, they all would not stiffen their backs and avert their eyes when they spoke to her. Perhaps then she could listen to them.",822,1,1,322,1,0.0900621118012422,0.124223602484472,0.0838509316770186,0.0496894409937888,0.0434782608695652,0.0652173913043478,0.183229813664596,0.0124223602484472,0.015527950310559,0.167701863354037,0.0031055900621118,0.158385093167702,0.0341614906832298,0,0.124223602484472,0.0031055900621118,0,0.000339506832209316,0.000339506832200134,0.000339506832203404,0.000339506832206235,0.000339506832202521,0.00033950683220355,0.997623452174567,0.000339506832207439

Any and all advancements made in the field of biology at this college in the past twenty years are a direct result of the frankly unbelievable quantity (and quality!) of man-hours logged by your father. I have been in contact with some of your professors and it appears that the metaphorical apple does not fall far from the tree, in this case at least. Though I am not certain how you may feel about undertaking a project with an old biology professor like myself, given that you are at the top of your class in psychology at present, I am confident you will find much overlap between the two fields. A bit of diligent studying and learning is all that is necessary to fill in any remaining gaps.  To the point. Your father requested his body be donated to science in the event of his untimely demise. I was granted the ability to give him a postmortem examination by the institution, and I found some results that are very inconsistent with the manner of his death. I am not suggesting foul play or negligence by the hospital; independent autopsies have ruled those avenues out, and I agree with their findings. I am suggesting, however, that something else could be at play. What, exactly? And how would I prove it? That’s where you would come in. I would like someone to develop tools, conduct experiments, run ideas by, regarding the inconsistencies I have found with your father. I have already run the same tests on a dozen other human cadavers, and three have shown similar inconsistencies.  I think there is something big out there that no one has discovered yet. I’d like your help getting to the bottom of it.",835,1,16,337,2,0.0712166172106825,0.121661721068249,0.0623145400593472,0.0919881305637982,0.029673590504451,0.0979228486646884,0.192878338278932,0.00890207715133531,0.0237388724035608,0.15727002967359,0.0029673590504451,0.127596439169139,0.0178041543026706,0,0.118694362017804,0.0029673590504451,0,0.000358851527737915,0.000358851527732854,0.000358851527733182,0.000358851527731167,0.000358851527733294,0.997488039305865,0.000358851527732928,0.000358851527733166

"837","She’d always been a cold sleeper. When she was younger, she had gotten into the habit of wearing thick wool socks and sweatshirts to bed, even in the summer. Her own parents hadn’t thought anything of it until Mrs. Pierceson, her friend’s mom, recalled seeing her under two heavy blankets and tangled up in a scarf at a sleepover when she was twelve. She went to a professional, and though they said it was unusual, they couldn’t find anything wrong with her. So, even if it meant waking up in pools of sweat, even if it meant extra laundry, it didn’t matter.  It was the way she had to do things.  Though this sleeping habit was not the entirety of the reason why the 10:15 alarm seemed to come so quickly, it was likely the cause of the blistering succession of shrill blaring that inevitably came at 10:30, and again at 10:45. Quinn Harper, plenty old enough now to understand the cycles of sleeping and waking, was always surprised that it was already time to get out of bed.

"838","She finally committed to keeping her eyes open some fleeting minutes later, and voyaged her feet to the floor more minutes after that. Then she laboriously threw her two weighted blankets across the bed and pulled off the sweatshirt she was wearing– her grandfather’s, and much too big for her, just the way she liked it.  Of course, there was the accompanying chill. It started at her fingertips and slid effortlessly up her arms and into her chest, between her ribs. Her teeth chattered, and her joints ached, and her nose ran. Saturday and Sunday were opportunities to lay in bed for hours, delaying this chill. There was no such luxury today. Quinn tried to stand, and ended up feeling grateful that she didn’t fall face first onto the floor. Sat back on the bed, she became fully aware of just how angrily her head pounded. It was as though her very consciousness was ready to split into thousands upon millions of independent pieces.  If she had felt this way some fourteen months ago, she may have called for an ambulance. Today, however, she sighed and reached to her nightstand for a small orange bottle.

Quinn ran her hands through her hair and reached for her phone.  To her surprise, someone had texted her- Ty. Of course it was Ty. She opened the message and read it as quickly as she could.

"840","She swiped away from the conversation and closed her eyes. She fought off a wave of guilt as she navigated toward another familiar name and hovered her thumbs above the keyboard.  She knew him as Nicholas, and he was an odd fellow. He was probably near sixty, with a great white beard, large glasses, and a tye-dyed bandana which never seemed to leave his balding head. He drove a vintage sports car with the mufflers removed and the speakers blasting, in spite of the fact that he had been arrested (by his own claim) six separate times. He smelled like a boys’ middle school locker room (some days, an overpowering mix of body spray and body odor; others, just the latter), he sent her conspiracy theory videos that she thought were confusing and odd, and his mannerisms and speech were stolen straight from the grassy fields of Woodstock 1969, despite the fact that she knew for certain that was before his time.  Nicholas was as enigmatic as he was odd. He was ex-military and ex-government, both of which he spoke proudly of. In fact, as a former member of the top-secret Delta Project committee in Washington, D.C., he had access to very vital information regarding government-funded projects which may have been viewed as less-than-ethical had the public been aware of their existence. Though Quinn did not know anything about other projects Nicholas was involved in, or even what Nicholas’ last name was, she knew that he was one of the few people– in the government, in the country, in the world– that was informed of what happened last spring in Colorado, and what had been happening for years prior.  She was grateful to have him. Really, she was grateful to Ty for putting her into contact with him. She was grateful to Ty for rounding up all of the scientists she didn’t kill at that ivy-covered building, and the Delta committee members, and coming up with a cover story, swearing them to secrecy, checking in with them regularly, becoming a de facto government official in addition to leading his own life, wherever that had taken him.

"841","She was grateful to Ty for protecting her. She should text him back. Shouldn’t she? The most crucial fact about Nicholas was that he sold her drugs that she did not have a prescription for. The empty bottle in the trash formerly contained nolazopam, a medication that millions across the world took every day to stem anxiety. Though the pills did tend to make her feel better, they served a very different purpose for Quinn. She’d made an accidental discovery in the wake of last year’s incident that drugs that she took affected dreamers- the invisible killing machines that she had a mental connection with- in often counterintuitive ways.

"842","Ordinarily these dreamers would beg their host, their Leader, for freedom to kill so often that it drove them insane. With nolazopam, Quinn had been able to limit their habits to one time per week. Still, the dreamers made themselves felt. Once Quinn had made her refill request to Nicholas, she attempted to stand again, steadying herself with a timid hand against her bed. Thousands of poking and prodding voices ran themselves across her skull, drying her mouth, reddening her eyes. Today marked six days since she had let them loose. Today, just as was the case last Thursday, and the Thursday before that, they begged her with particularly malicious levels of ferocity, knowing perhaps on some base animal level that they were about to receive exactly what they wanted.  But the pills she had taken were beginning to do their work, and Quinn was able to shuffle her way across her small bedroom, across the hallway, and into the bathroom. She turned the shower knob as far to the right as it could go, and slowly peeled off her clothes as steam began to flood the bathroom.  There was a small window at eye level in that shower, a feature which Quinn initially found unsettling, but eventually had come to appreciate. There were more trees in Arizona than she’d thought, at least near her grandparents’ house. Though they were numerous, they weren’t very dense, standing more like individual watchmen than moshing concert-goers. On clear nights such as this one, she loved wiping steam off the window and taking in blurry views of the trees in the moonlight. She could be anywhere, save for the giveaway of the dry, dead ground.

"843","She felt alone, looking out that window. It was peaceful. By the time she stepped out of the shower and ran a toothbrush across her teeth and had thrown on the clothes she’d haphazardly laid out for herself the previous morning, she was beginning to feel better. It was the getting going that was the real problem for Quinn. Once she was in rhythm, once the pills had taken their effect, once that deathly chill had left her body, she went through long stretches of feeling as though life made sense.  She took one last glance at herself in the mirror. Her shirt was a bit wrinkled, and her hair wouldn’t be dry for some time still. The bags under her eyes which started to form when she’d taken the night shift had only grown deeper. She hadn’t said this to anybody, or even really allowed herself to think it, but she felt as though she looked much older than twenty-three.  But that didn’t really bother her. At any rate, she concluded, it was a good thing she wasn’t working in modeling.

"844","She strode past her grandparents’ room, where a ray of changing light and soft dialogue from some sitcom spilled out of a small crack between the door and the wall. They had stayed up for her during her first week, but since then, she had been departing from and arriving to a still household. She grabbed the keys from the rack and felt the dry spring air on her face. For three seasons of the year, she would have loved to work outside, right there on the front lawn, doing anything at all. Winters in Flagstaff could still be miserable. That she knew all too well. Instead, though, she dragged herself into her grandmother’s car and set off for the motel, just as she had done every weeknight for ten months prior. If her car back home was old, this thing was prehistoric; it featured windows that had to be cranked to open and a safety rating that must have been below zero on any credible website. Beyond that, it was an ugly olive green color, and it had a certain old smell that was hard to describe but impossible to ignore.  She didn’t hate it, though. As long as it got her from starting point to destination, and no one was around to heckle her for it, she figured there was no problem.",844,1,-11,226,3,0.0752212389380531,0.115044247787611,0.0884955752212389,0.079646017699115,0.0442477876106195,0.0929203539823009,0.168141592920354,0.0132743362831858,0.0398230088495575,0.13716814159292,0,0.119469026548673,0.0265486725663717,0,0.123893805309735,0,0,0.000578660943627387,0.000578660943622353,0.000578660943625296,0.000578660943626269,0.000578660943640186,0.995949373394589,0.000578660943630823,0.000578660943638754
"845","She pulled into her spot at the motel one minute before her shift was due to start. She had her commute down to a science, and she was proud of it. Since nearly every ride was uneventful and traffic-free, she did her best to hit the same speeds on every road for maximum replicability. She’d leave at nine minutes to midnight, arrive eight minutes later, go in, nod to Jeff, who was on before her, then he would punch out (as it was, by now, exactly midnight), and she’d take over, all without a word.  It was exactly what work should be.  But tonight, as she stepped into the reception area of the Up and Away Motel, she saw Dan, her boss, manning the desk. Though Dan wasn’t necessarily a striking figure– mid-forties, maybe five and a half feet tall, with a receding hairline, and a tie that somehow was always too short for his already smallish body– Quinn nearly lept upon seeing the physical manifestation of a minor break in her routine.  She steadied herself and glanced at the clock over his head.

"846","He smiled without moving his eyes. ""Morning, Quinn. I was, ah, hoping to speak with you in the break room."" Her heart sank, and Dan must have noticed, because he practically fell over himself assuring her that ""Oh, you’re not in trouble, I didn’t mean to give you that impression, don’t worry."" Quinn’s momentary dread was supplanted by confusion.

He took a seat at the table in the center of the room and extended his arm out, inviting her to sit with him. It was a bit of an awkward fit– both the table and chairs may have been recycled from the local elementary school– but Quinn found herself seated across from her boss.

With that, her boss pushed past her and out of the room. Quinn’s mouth hung open as she tried to make sense of what had happened.  After a moment of stillness, she re-entered the reception area. Though many of the rooms themselves were in need of deep cleaning, she and the rest of the desk clerks did a decent job of making their shared space as homely as possible. A few monthly magazines rested on coffee tables next to cushy chairs resting on fashionable throw rugs. Management had even splurged on a television for the area, a crucial fixture for late nights and early mornings behind the desk.  For now, though, Quinn hustled to the computer behind her desk and, not knowing what else to look for, typed her own name into the search bar. She scrolled past result after result, mostly in regards to an overseas company which bore her name. That wasn’t it.

She let out an audible groan as she clicked the link to read it.  ASN Shows Promise with Hour-Long Special Sunk By Jeremy Mountcastle You’d be forgiven, in our world of ever-accelerating consumption and disposal of content, if you had forgotten about the Pacific submarine tragedy that claimed the lives of thirty-seven, even if it was only a year ago. Similarly, you might have missed last week’s launch of ASN, the action storytelling network, which promises to be as captivating as it is informative, with a Southwestern flavor. Though the new network is still in its infancy, and I remain skeptical in regards to its long-term outlook in the aforementioned world of today, I must admit that it has produced a winner with its maiden foray into the world of television specials, Sunk.",851,1,0,164,3,0.0731707317073171,0.121951219512195,0.0426829268292683,0.0670731707317073,0.0121951219512195,0.0853658536585366,0.201219512195122,0.0121951219512195,0.0182926829268293,0.109756097560976,0.0975609756097561,0.121951219512195,0.0487804878048781,0.00609756097560976,0.109756097560976,0,0,0.000545261710561845,0.996183168026073,0.000545261710560472,0.000545261710558914,0.000545261710556179,0.0005452617105675,0.000545261710561748,0.000545261710560855
"852","Deftly paced and emotionally charged, Sunk retells the events leading up to the Pacific’s demise through the lens of Maeve Harper (Greta Wersching), the only child aboard, with her own tragic backstory to boot. The special’s focus on the exploration of her relationship with her father Steven (Johnathan Rudd) and his boss Dorothy (Mia Green) rather than the jargon-laden reasons why the ship sank gives ample room for viewers to empathize with sufferers of disaster of this scale, a concept in short supply now, given the rate at which disasters seem to be happening nationwide.  Wersching, far from a household name in the United States, is as funny and convincing as she is heartbreaking. The rest of the cast is nearly flawless as well, and the appearance by real-life Steven’s childhood friend caps the program off quite powerfully. Though the so-called expert cameos were a bit of a misstep, often breaking immersion rather than enhancing it, they did not detract from what otherwise was an unexpected triumph of a television show. ASN has shown for the first time that it’s not all talk. With a small budget, its ability to field a cast, build a convincingly claustrophobic submarine from scratch, and tell a cohesive story is impressive, and hopefully indicative of things to come.

"854","The laundry room was just down the hall. She’d made the trip hundreds of times, sometimes just when she needed to walk at three or four o’clock in the morning. Tonight, it was particularly hot and humid in that room. Both washing machines and dryers were running, probably because Dan had started them before he left. He’d run off awfully quickly, hadn’t he? At least the dirty laundry was all in one big basket, and the clean laundry was folded and ready to go, so she wouldn’t have to worry about that tonight. The dryer against the wall was making some kind of noise, though. She could have sworn it was getting worse over the course of the past few weeks. Maybe they’d have to pay to get that fixed, and she knew the motel wasn’t making a lot of money. But if management had the money for a television, they should certainly have enough for a lousy dryer, right? What good was a motel with wet bedsheets and pillowcases? Why was she here again? She took a handful of slow steps out of the laundry room and saw the face of the young man, still waiting at the desk. She felt her heart hammer against her chest. Towel. That’s what he wanted. Towel. Repeating the word to herself (and pulling back after reaching into the dirty pile first, for some reason), she retrieved a towel and brought it back to the man.

"859","She sat down in her chair and rocked back and forth, warring with herself over the contents of her hypothetical response. The damage had already been done, hadn’t it? The details of the submarine sinking were already out there, fabricated by the right people, appearing on the right websites. She’d done one supplemental interview, a short, pathetic thing in front of leech people who were only out to make her cry. Fortunately, she hadn’t, and public interest in the case of the drowned science expedition had expired before it ever had a chance to stir up.  But even if someone had seen the special and wanted more about what happened, they could find details online, or wherever, and it would all add up. As far as she could remember, the review article didn’t mention anything about a conspiracy, or new clues that threatened to uncover the real truth of the Pacific. Even if some whackjob went to the site of the wreckage, they would find a submarine. That’s what Ty told her, at least, the first week she was in the hospital. She was not well then, not by a long shot. But she was sure he had said it.  As the clock moved to one, Quinn began to feel herself breathe once more. She’d overreacted. She wished she hadn’t had to find out about the show through her boss a week after it had already aired, sure, but what harm could it possibly do? Their bases had been covered a year ago, and if there was a real problem, Ty would call himself. It was fine, she wasn’t even in the show herself, the actress probably looked nothing like her sister anyway; she’d live her life, in just the same way she had been. She didn’t have to text Ty.

"860","She spent the next hour or so scouring for more information online. The only thing she learned was that the websites which mentioned the special tended to look more like viruses than reputable news sources. If the motel’s computer wasn’t well over a decade old and clearly nearing the end of its functionality, she may have been a bit more careful with her browsing habits.  By the time Quinn had reached the bottom of the fifth page of results, she’d had enough. She rubbed her eyes, closed every tab on the computer, and opened up solitaire. It was her favorite game to pass the time during work. It required just enough thinking to make the minutes slip past, but not enough to where it was ever taxing. Sometimes she made little doodles on a company-provided notepad for the same reason. She must have filled a dozen of them with pictures of the interior of houses, human figures, animals, mountains, anything she could think of to draw. She was not an artist, by any stretch of the imagination, but she figured she must be improving, given the sheer quantity of free time she had to practice.  For the rest of the night, only one person approached the desk– an older man with a thick accent who was something of a mythical figure among the motel employees. At an hour when most were drooling, he paraded up to the desk, drew himself up to his full height, and spoke so loud that the ground seemed to shake. ""Ah, so it is Miss Quinn tonight!"" he said, laying- but really more like slamming-  both of his hands on the desk.",860,1,11,281,3,0.0782918149466192,0.120996441281139,0.0711743772241993,0.0604982206405694,0.0284697508896797,0.120996441281139,0.213523131672598,0.00355871886120996,0.0320284697508897,0.106761565836299,0.0106761565836299,0.135231316725979,0.0177935943060498,0,0.131672597864769,0.00355871886120996,0,0.000380533896609103,0.000380533896607648,0.997336262723736,0.000380533896606835,0.000380533896608985,0.000380533896614332,0.000380533896609331,0.000380533896607591

When he said this, he laughed, a giant, booming outburst that could have rattled leaves free from trees.  Though it was an exercise of atrophied muscles for Quinn, she laughed, too.  She made the commute home at eight o’clock opposite children who had managed to drag their feet just long enough to be late for school and nine-to-fivers who were especially eager to get to their desks. The road was often a bit perilous at this time, as highly caffeinated business people fought to coexist with sleepy sixteen-year-olds who were still learning to drive, and traffic had not yet mounted such that no one could get anywhere anyway.

"864","Ordinarily, she resented the trek home. But today, remembering her interaction with Mr. Shesterkin and feeling somewhat satisfied with how a drawing of hers had gone, she made a rare decision to throw the radio on. To do this, she had to turn a small dial to adjust a red needle to exactly the station she wanted. She’d struggled to learn to navigate the dial quickly, and without much interference, a skill she’d once thought only necessary for people three times her age. She decided on one of her favorites– 92.7, which played oldies– and spent a few seconds fighting through static to reach it.  She smiled wryly. It was Dylan. God, what a grating voice, she thought, ignoring the blaring horn that resulted from a BMW cutting off a beat-up looking minivan ahead of her. It was Blowin’ in the Wind, overplayed to hell, and too vague to mean much of anything, in her opinion.  Still, she hummed along. ./.",864,1,0,164,4,0.0670731707317073,0.0914634146341463,0.0731707317073171,0.0182926829268293,0.0304878048780488,0.0914634146341463,0.158536585365854,0.0182926829268293,0.0548780487804878,0.146341463414634,0.0365853658536585,0.176829268292683,0.00609756097560976,0,0.201219512195122,0,0,0.000606524806491047,0.000606524806494872,0.00060652480649104,0.000606524806491555,0.000606524806491843,0.000606524806490693,0.99575432635456,0.000606524806488984
"865","Two cups of coffee sat on the kitchen table. In fifteen minutes or so, the owner of the one on the left would shuffle into the kitchen and rest his weight against a chair. He’d take a sip from his cup, decide how long it needed in the microwave, and give the cup on the right an extra ten seconds. When the right cup’s owner woke up, hers would be the perfect temperature.  Both coffee drinkers were retired and childless, so they spent every morning together at home. The owner of the left cup liked to watch the news, and kept up with local politics. He had been very active in his church community when he was younger, and still went every week, despite his failing hips and sight. Many parishioners came to visit him, and they found great joy in bringing lunch and listening to a rambling story or two. The owner of the right cup was a naturalist, constantly hiking with a group of friends she’d found online or battling the unforgiving climate to grow vegetables in her backyard garden.  The two would sit and chat about the news or the weather or something one of them had remembered. And there was certainly no shortage of memories to relive. In 1971, he’d been an aspiring politician and she was studying to break into the male-dominated field of biology.

"866","Today, they would drink coffee together, through forty-eight years of marriage.  The pair were creatures of habit, as many are at their stage of life, and for this reason they would not thank the person who had made the beverages for them. This person wanted to keep to themself, and do gosh-knows-what, not that husband nor wife was dying to figure out what exactly they did anyway. The coffee drinkers loved them, knew they needed space, and could not have imagined going through what they did at such a young age. So, most of the time, at their previous request, upstairs was theirs, and downstairs belonged to him and her.  Sometimes, after they’d finished their cups and begun their day, one of the drinkers would walk up to the coffee maker’s room and stop at the door. There was rarely any noise coming from inside– no talking, no music, sometimes their television would be on, but that wasn’t often. She would come downstairs and say she was worried about them; he would say they just needed more time, and both would move forward with their own days. The coffee maker was still young, after all; they had their whole life ahead of them. Yet they were older than both he and she were when she jumped into his arms walking down the aisle. By their age, he’d put a down payment on a house, and she was readying herself to have children. Both had achieved degrees and paved the way for future careers. Though the coffee drinkers never communicated it to one another, they wondered just what it was the coffee maker needed.

She hadn’t bothered to change, or even kick off her shoes, but that didn’t matter. Her medication was wearing off, and she’d kept them waiting long enough.  She closed her eyes. It was not at all like falling asleep. The transition was much more like when she’d had her appendectomy during her first year of college.

Instead of the lumpiness of the hospital bed and the nausea that came with the aftereffects of the anesthesia, however, today Quinn found herself awake in the collective consciousness of some vast amount of dreamers. She may have found it a difficult feeling to describe, had she ever needed to do so, but it was more or less like sitting in a director’s chair and watching one million different television shows at the same time. They weren’t very hard to keep track of, though, because she was also the one acting in all of the shows.  Directing and acting. That was all it was.  One of the shows was set in the crowded center of a city. Though it was impossible for her to know which city exactly, it was at least midday there, so it had to be east of the director’s chair.

"869","The leading actor of this show had already picked a mark. He was middle-aged, bald, talking on the phone. He wore glasses that concealed deep wrinkles below his eyes and walked with a limp that was only just noticeable. Though his face was pale, when he laughed or shouted, he turned red. A good actor uses their intuition. Even if the outcome is predetermined, even if the lines are scripted, it is important for an actor to engage with their own feelings and attitudes toward a scene. This particular actor knew it was never in the script for them to drive a gash through their mark’s neck and watch them bleed out on the sidewalk, because that would have been reckless and irresponsible. But they could have achieved the outcome they were after by stopping his heart. The man would go down, doctors would perform an autopsy, and they’d probably reason that he had an undiagnosed cardiac disease.  Intuitively, however, this actor knew they did not want to stop his heart. Maybe someone next to him knew CPR and would spring into action, maybe doctors wouldn’t find anything anomalous about his heart and launch some sort of an investigation, maybe the whole event just wasn’t big enough. No, this actor was not interested in that.  This one jumped up on the man’s shoulders as it realized what it wanted to do. It would start in the thyroid, innocently enough, but it would metastasize quickly. The whole process would be slow, on the scale of many years, with family members involved, and lots of money spent, but this actor would get what it wanted in the end.

With the ground spinning sideways, she baby-crawled to the trash can. It took every bit of determination and will she had, but she made it. And without a second to spare.

"874","Quinn sat next to the trash can for several minutes, attempting to discern whether she would throw up again. Though she was not feeling any better, and the smell of the room was beyond foul, and she likely looked a mess, too, she decided that it was time to move. As the room was still spinning, she continued to crawl back to her dresser and reached clumsily for the handle that opened the drawer. Once she grabbed it, she fought through discarded hair ties and crumpled-up pieces of paper to find her emergency stash of pills.  There were five of them, all together, and when her shaking hand finally stumbled upon the little white capsules, she was so excited that she dropped them all on the floor. Fighting the urge to cry out, she began to scavenge the area. One landed right in front of her. Two had nearly rolled its way under the dresser. Three and Four were together at an arm’s length underneath the bed.  She swallowed them all. She was almost certain she’d eaten some carpet as well, as she could feel strands of hair scratch their way down her throat.  She fought back the renewed urge to vomit again.

"875","Her eyes scanned the floor for the final pill. She looked under the furniture, in the gaps left by placement of previous furniture, among crumbs she’d been meaning to vacuum. She had no luck until she turned to the corner of the room she’d just wobbled from.  There was Five, leaning upright against the trash can, as though it was proud of itself.  Quinn closed her eyes and let the strengthening of the smell guide her. This strategy was not bulletproof, however. Her hand made contact with the can before she realized she’d made it that far. Had Quinn failed to display some impressive reflexes, considering the circumstances, the nearly-overflowing trash can would have dumped its contents onto her carpet. She took a slow breath, rolled over into a seated position, and took the last pill while holding her nose. Gradually, the world began to stop spinning.

"876","She took cautious steps to the bathroom and turned on the tap. As the sink filled with water, she brushed her teeth in a desperate attempt to purge the taste of bile from her mouth. She spat in the toilet once, twice, three times.  She still felt sick. When she was done, she set her toothbrush down and submerged her head completely in the water. God, was it cold. She turned her neck in every direction to ensure her hair was clean. As she resurfaced and grabbed a towel, she took a look in the mirror. Today, she didn’t feel old.

"902","Quinn scowled, and with trembling hands, reached into her nightstand drawer for a third time that morning. This time, she had to go all the way to the back to find what she was after. Underneath old grocery lists, coffee-stained napkins, and birthday cards from distant relatives, her hand pushed past a paper trail of the last months of her life.  In fact, it had been so long since she’d seen this item she was worried it may have faded, or ripped, or disappeared somehow. But it hadn’t.  It was a developed photo of Quinn and Maeve at Maeve’s kindergarten graduation. They were in the elementary school gymnasium, which was a furnace. It was always humid in that old building, and the gym was not air conditioned, making recess and phys ed almost unbearable. The day of her sister’s graduation, which Quinn only vaguely remembered, as she was twelve at the time, was during the then-hottest June in the state’s history. To make things worse, all of the parents and siblings were packed like sardines during the ceremony, which lasted at least ninety minutes more than it should have. Both sisters were sweaty and tired, as was apparent in the photo. But someone– maybe a teacher, maybe a friend, maybe a parent– had made a joke just before the camera flashed, and so despite the abject misery of the day, Quinn and Maeve were caught in bouts of uncontrollable laughter. Quinn handed the picture over to Cassius, who studied it for a long moment.

"910","She realized something, that particular morning. The memories, seared into her brain one by one, the memories which cut like knives into her flesh and sat like a weight upon her chest every time she returned from the infinitesimal respite of sleep, seemed somehow to be dulled by whatever trance she found herself in on those Fridays. She could push those memories aside for stretches, after all, if she really tried. In fact, over time, she had become quite proficient at doing so. Today’s memory, like a demon, lived within her, alongside her; it pulsed in her temples, overriding her own heartbeat, it had its own motives and feelings, it developed and matured. The thing that she had done– it had done– of course, she had done– to that man was a who, more than it was a what. And this who made its introduction to Quinn as soon as Cassius left her house.  She lay on her bed for hours, wishing for an end, begging to transcend her feelings, to strike a deal with this who.

"916","The park was less than a quarter-mile from her house, if she cut through her backyard, and she set out at a decent pace. Though no clouds saved Quinn’s eyes from the relentless glare of the sun, it was a mild day out, cool enough to make her feel grateful she’d been wearing long sleeves. She stepped over sticks and rocks and roots and listened to the crunch of her footsteps on the ground. The ground was dry and brittle, and it seemed audibly to object to any weight that shifted upon it. She’d been this way dozens of times, and she’d go this way dozens more, for as long as— She stopped. She was being watched.  A shadow had darted across the corner of her eye, or maybe it was a noise she’d heard. She wasn’t completely sure why she felt it, but she trusted her instinct.  She spun around and craned her neck in an attempt to find her stalker. She was just deep enough into the woods that she could no longer see her house. Her heart began to thump against her ribcage as she scanned disinterested tree after disinterested tree. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

"917","Quinn rubbed her neck as she performed a final 360-degree scope of her surroundings. A false alarm. I’m stressed out, she thought. I’m being irrational. Still, when she resumed her journey toward the park, she moved quietly and methodically, on the edge of a knife.  Every time she passed a tree, she retreated behind it, to ensure no one was hiding there. It slowed her progress, certainly, but she had to do it, just to prove to herself how irrational she was being.  She performed dozens of these checks over the span of several minutes. Though she was largely unaware of it, she shook, having tensed most of the muscles in her body. Still, despite her vigilance, despite her thoroughness, she found nothing.

Part of the front of the house was constructed with flat disc-like rocks, which made the residency look more like an art museum than a place of living. A ten-foot-wide window on the second floor overlooked a patch of golf course that was visible through the tree cover, and on the balcony of the top floor, someone sat in a hot tub, lazily looking down at their car through a pair of sunglasses.

It was every bit as magnificent on the inside as it was on the outside. The front door opened directly into what appeared to be the living room, which was larger than the entirety of her old house’s upstairs floor. The ceiling was made of polished wood, and it let in natural light at angles which seemed to make the white walls glow. A virtual fireplace complimented what was decidedly an earthy decorating style– pinecones filled a crate on the coffee table, three detailed diagrams of leaves were mounted on the back wall, and the art-museum rocks visible from outside lined the edge of an attached kitchen. The whole place was spotless, and open; it was as though Quinn had set foot in the largest and most comfortable camping tent of all time.

Valerie surveyed her, up and down, with large, brown eyes that had been hidden to Quinn before.

Young person stuff? Yoga and herbal supplements? Or something? Nicholas didn’t exactly give her the complete manual.  Valerie effortlessly navigated the kitchen in silence. She grabbed two bananas from a basket beside the stove, peeled them bare, and threw them into a blender.

"962","Quinn was not unfamiliar with death. She had learned about it from stories and the news when she was small. It came for her old high school in a very public way two Septembers ago, and she had seen it take her sister from her arms. She had caused it to claim others, indirectly, semi-directly, by her own hand. Still, as she watched Valerie walk back down the stairs, perfect hair, perfect clothes, perfect body, she realized she had somehow failed to understand what it was trying to tell her. Sitting behind her desk at the motel, or lying in her bed, hours and days were expendable, things to be trodden through and hopefully forgotten.  But now, as she held conversation with Valerie in the passenger’s seat, and fought off questions about her secret job, and laughed at the jokes she made; as she squinted against the sunlight which was as fierce as though it had been reflected by a magnifying glass, or by the sharp edges of a boy who wanted to know the truth; as she swallowed the visual of a red-faced man talking on the phone, and fifty others from weeks past, she understood what death meant, what she had long known on some level to be true. She was running out of time. And it scared her.

It was always eerily quiet on the days they met. Though this was by design, she still found it odd to walk through empty hallways and dark classrooms and barren offices to get to her meetings. Even the stench of tobacco, ingrained so deeply into the essence of the building, seemed to hide from her on these Saturdays. Dorothy reached her destination– an unimpressive wooden door, which guarded a seemingly unimpressive lab space, not any larger than the classrooms– and performed the secret knock, in three distinct groups of three.

Quinn dropped her pencil and held the loose leaf sheet at an angle in an attempt to catch the first rays of the morning sun. She studied the way the light tickled the page, the way it made the deeper lines shine, the way it blended her thinner marks with the color of the sheet itself. The fluorescent lamp she’d been working under for the past several hours was serviceable, sure, and it probably held the distinction of being the object most responsible for her enduring sanity at the Up and Away Motel. But it simply could not compare to natural light, she thought, wiping away a stray eraser shaving from the corner of her work.

She placed the sheet back onto the desk and began the editing process. She was a deliberate artist, but not a very ambitious one; her projects almost always moved from idea to finished product within the confines of a shift. Today, however, she would be unable to complete her landscape in the five minutes she had remaining. The thought excited her, especially on the precipice of a weekend. If nothing else, she’d given herself something to look forward to when she came in the following Monday.  When Quinn had reached a suitable stopping point, she carefully slid the page into a drawer underneath the reception desk. Every desk clerk had their own, and it was considered a fireable offense to rummage through someone else’s, except in cases involving unpleasant odor. Though she hadn’t been around long enough to witness the enforcement of this exception, she’d heard unverifiable stories about rotting food and bad weed and an awful prank involving a dead mouse.

Her first instinct was to simply give up and go home– but she was running low on pills, and they had worked well. They had done their job so well, in fact, that she was hopeful she could stretch the seven-day cycle she was currently dealing with to ten, or perhaps longer. In any case, they weren’t crying out to her as loudly or as urgently as they usually did on Friday mornings, and for that she was grateful. She didn’t want to ruin that momentum.  Her second instinct, then, was to call Nicholas and explain everything. Maybe he had a backup supply, maybe she wouldn’t have to text Valerie and risk whatever it was she thought she was risking. But the more she explored this instinct, the more cowardly she felt. She was an adult, Valerie was an adult, they had agreed to do this last week. She had looked forward to doing this last week. The small blue cursor blinked optimistically at Quinn. She had to ask Valerie to drop off the rest of the pills. Did Valerie remember where she lived? What about the spot that she and Nicholas usually met at? Should she be vague, in case someone else read her text? Or straight to the point? Should she be funny? Sarcastic? What was Valerie like? What text would she want to get, if she was Valerie and Valerie was her? Quinn began typing, deleted her draft, then did it again. The more she thought, the more she decided her worst nightmare would be to actually enter a text conversation with Valerie. She could hardly stand sending one message.

Quinn had been on the fence about using the word ""meet"" instead of ""drop off"", but she eventually decided that her text was as good as it was going to get. Through two big breaths, she hit send and began the journey home. It seemed as though the world was driving just a bit slower than normal. Unfortunately, because the clock next to her dashboard was also moving a bit slower than normal, she could not find reasonable grounds to lose her temper at the mother in the minivan who would not budge from the left lane. She did, however, have a legitimate gripe with the sun, which shone so amicably at her earlier that morning.

The dancing and the smuggled alcohol and the cheapest expensive food her high school could buy did not sum up to an unforgettable night for her, as so many of her classmates claimed it did for them, whether they truly believed it or they simply felt that it was the right thing to say.  At any rate, the dress and the night seemed to share an identity. The dress was blue, a color she picked because it seemed less conspicuous than red or black, a color that was much deeper in person than it was online, a color she had no direct qualms with but one she did not love. It fit her decently well, certainly well enough for her to wear out, but not well enough to the point where she felt beautiful, if that was even a possibility. In some ways, she thought, examining herself in the mirror, feeling cool air against her exposed back, it was perfect for tonight.

"1023","Quinn hung up the phone and threw it into her handbag, a cheap old thing she’d stored under her bed since she got it on her eighteenth birthday.  She walked halfway across the room. There was the mirror, bidding her one last farewell. She tried to ignore it, but it called to her, as it calls to everyone, especially on nights like this. It showed her the old handbag, the too-blue dress, the hair, which she’d taken hours to get right to little avail, and the face, adorned with what little makeup she knew to use, applied by an unsteady and sorely underqualified hand. The mirror seemed to delight in this goodbye, in this condemnation of her effort, but not because she was pathetic, or ugly, although at times, she believed both of those things to be true. The mirror, in its stoic, unflinching way, showed Quinn something starkly unlike herself. It couldn’t explain to her exactly why this thing had joined it in its effort to send her off, but it did show her just how plastic, how stretched around the edges, how alien the thing truly was.  She fought off an urge to crack the mirror and run away. How wonderful it might feel, knocking one of the smug bastard’s teeth out. It had no idea what she was going through. Why should it get to judge her? Yet as the farewell echoed in her mind, she began to understand that the mirror had hidden something beneath its mocking. She took a deep breath. You win. I’ll bite. She looked it in the eye and asked it what it was hiding. To her surprise, it told her, in clear terms.

"1045","She could hear them drumming on the wooden floor from outside, unmistakably rising in volume.  She had thought about her drawing on the ride over, and what she would do on Monday to fix those damn mountains. They weren’t misshapen anymore, but they still weren’t right. Maybe they needed more snow, maybe she’d need to blur the base, to simulate fog; she didn’t know how she’d attempt that, but perhaps she’d have to try.  She thought about Dan, who was likely still at the motel, manning that lonely desk. What could he have in his drawer? A few fantastic ideas passed through her mind– what if it was a gun, or stacks of cash, or a secret cell phone?– and though he probably could have managed to hide any one of those things with impunity, she decided the most exciting thing he ever stored probably was whatever cold sandwich he’d brought for lunch. She’d even managed an idle chuckle at the contrast of the two cars nestled together in the driveway. It had all ceased to be real, for a short time, and she found she’d taken for granted how wonderfully abstract the moment she was in had once been.

"1046","The door swung open, and there she was. Gorgeous, objectively gorgeous, offensively gorgeous, a beauty beyond dispute or defense. Quinn’s eyes watered and her throat ran dry as she hugged her in greeting. With every ounce of effort she could muster, she tied herself to the present.  ""Come in! Oh my God. They’re gonna be here any second."" Quinn followed Valerie inside. The living room looked completely different under artificial light– if it was a rustic hub of exploration last week, tonight it felt more apt for homework-doing and dish-washing, those homely Sunday night tasks that come with the admission that another week will come, after all. As Quinn sat down on her drug dealer’s couch once more, she thought that it would not have been so bad to spend the night in, basking in this feeling, remembering when the pinnacle of her worries was a social studies test or a road match against her rival high school.  But the energy with which Valerie moved was a reminder that it was a Friday night, and that they would be spending it at Paulie’s, a bar notorious for its sticky floors and hazardous bathrooms. Her host sped to the counter and poured two glasses of white wine, downing one as she handed the other to Quinn. Before she even had the chance to thank her, Valerie sped up the stairs and out of sight.

""Ok. Be honest. How do I look?"" She stuck her arms out and spun around. Her satin dress was solid black, and nearly floor-length, so she looked like a shadow as she twirled. The material wrapped around her neck in the front and was tied together so that an oversized bow covered her back. The outfit was equal parts conservative and curve-hugging, subdued and elegant; the contrast of the jewelry on her wrists and ears with the color of the dress was undeniable. All of this was to ignore her hair, just the color and style Quinn had dreamed of since she was eleven years old, and her face, quite possibly the most unrelentingly perfect thing Quinn had ever seen.

"1058","The bar was at the dividing line between upscale suburbia and the edges of downtown, tucked into a plaza which also contained a Pizza Hut and a Dollar Tree. Richer folk from Valerie’s direction tended to cherish the spot as a harmless, temporary look into how the other half lived, with broken knickknacks, processed food, and the smell of stale beer a reminder that fun was cheap, and of who and what they were ultimately above. People who were not so well off came with their family and friends to share in a culture perpetuated by tough luck and winding stories and inexpensive authenticity, a culture misunderstood by many, including those who took part in it. At any rate, as Quinn put her feet onto gravel, stretched her back, and stared at the neon sign which read ""Pale’s"", since the ""u"" and the ""i"" had burnt out, she could not shake the feeling that she was an atheist standing on hallowed ground. Nate and Valerie led the way, his arm wrapped around her shoulder. A few paces behind them, Quinn and Coop traded furtive glances at one another, exchanging no conversation. Though it was true that Quinn was not an experienced bargoer, her extensive Google review research of this place had proven to be an appropriate expenditure of her time. The floors were, indeed, sticky; she could feel the soles of her shoes latch and begrudgingly unlatch from the dirty tile floor with each step. There was a small wooden stage at the far end of the bar upon which nail heads poked their way up from below. The felt on the pool table had almost completely eroded, the smell of tobacco hung in the air, and every so often, the already dim lights flickered. In this way, she was relieved. She’d pictured a true dive bar, and she’d gotten it.  But, of course, there was the rest of the night to attend to. Nate and Valerie took two seats at the counter, Cooper took the one next to them, and Quinn, who always seemed to walk slower than everyone else in a group, was forced to sit two boys away from the only person she hardly knew in the whole bar.

"1068","For the next fifteen minutes or so, Quinn learned a few more things about Coop– he was studying history at school, he had a brother, his parents were farmers. None of these things particularly interested her, but she attempted to extract them because the effort of doing so was all that separated her from complete silence. She attempted to tell a story or two of her own, at first adhering to the truth, but then steadily incorporating exaggerations and lies in a simple attempt to make their conversation more exciting. Even this tactic was unsuccessful. She had eventually wrapped herself up in telling him that she was aspiring to be the first woman to land on the moon. Judging by Coop’s reaction, she may well have claimed that she was in training to be the manager at the local Target. But, as the minutes passed, Quinn did begin to take notice of a few peculiarities. The first, and the most obvious, was Coop’s ability to put away scotches. He downed his first three as though they were water, and he’d just spent the entirety of a summer day behind home plate. Though he slowed a bit after this, Quinn lost track of what number he was on in relatively short order. Despite all that he was drinking, she did not see a change in him, other than in his face, which began to flush again.  Quinn also kept intermittent tabs on Valerie. She seemed always to be touching Nate– his shoulders, his arms, his hair, his legs. The first drink she ordered was a colorful cocktail, one that stained her tongue blue as she finished it. But the next was a copy of her own– a Blue Moon in a glass. Quinn, in no mood to finish the drink, sipped hers until it was halfway gone. During long breaks in her conversation with Coop, she would look over his shoulder to find that Valerie, too, had seemed to give up on her beer, in the same spot Quinn had.

"1069","The final detail she took note of was that an unmistakable energy had grown in the bar. When they had arrived, there were thirty or forty other patrons, a decent number for the smallish venue, but nowhere near its capacity. The general chatter was more or less at the same volume as the music, which alternated between inoffensive pop rock and dance. But the longer she pressed on through her conversation with Coop, the more frequently she heard the front door swing open. It wasn’t long before large groups of people had to resort to standing on that putrid floor, in between the booths that lined the wall and the bar itself. The effect was two-fold: first, that the temperature in the cramped building, already hot, rose further; second, that the background level of noise grew exponentially, making Quinn’s communication with her supposed date an exercise in lip-reading, rather than in listening. Finally, just when she was convinced that one more group of people would make the bar explode, a small woman wearing the same t-shirt as their bartender stood on a chair directly behind them and clanged a wooden spoon on a metal pot.  The bar fell dead silent. Quinn’s ears rang. ""Friday night karaoke starts in five minutes!

"1070","The floor shook as the bulls charged the counter. Gary must have been the bartender’s name, and he had happened to be refilling Nate’s drink at the time of the announcement. Quinn could not help but laugh as she ducked and covered her head, absorbing bumps and shoves from rabid patrons.  So it was karaoke. She had begun to worry that they were about to sit in on a cult meeting, or a riot organization, given the manner in which the bar had gained momentum. Once things settled down, it would be better listening to happy drunks misremember tunes than talking to Coop.  Eventually, the mad dash settled down, and the makings of a line began to snake from the back of the bar to Gary, who wrote names down on an oversized pad.

"1074","""I don’t– Are you crazy? I can’t do this!"" Valerie stopped, a risk given the density with which the bargoers were packed. They stood so close to one another they were nearly touching.    ""We are gonna go up there, and we are gonna sing Close My Eyes Forever, and I’m gonna be Ozzy, and you’re gonna be Lita. It doesn’t matter if you don’t know the song, just make something up.

Perhaps it was the words Valerie had said, or perhaps it was the look in her deep brown eyes. Maybe it was their proximity to one another, or the feeling of her warm breath on her face, or a combination of everything that had happened that night. But Quinn, who happened to know the song in question quite well, squeezed Valerie’s hand, and followed her the rest of the way to the stage without complaint.

"1075","As it turned out, Valerie’s estimation was correct. The pair had finished their painstaking traversal of the fifty feet or so which separated their seats at the bar and the stage just as the woman banged her wooden spoon on the pot once more.  ""Alright!"" she said, from the middle of the bar. ""If you’re in line, stay in line. Everyone’s gonna get a chance to go. Okay? First up is… Valerie and Quinn, singing Close My Eyes Forever. Valerie? Quinn? Where are you guys at?"" The stage was raised three or four feet above the floor, and they were in the process of climbing up. Though Quinn momentarily regretted her choice of jeans for the acrobatic exercise, she soon found herself standing, microphone in hand, before hundreds of expectant eyes.  The lights dimmed. A screen on the back wall projected the opening lyrics. The first notes of the guitar chord echoed with surprising strength over the speakers.

"1076","Quinn had been in many musicals, met with a handful of vocal instructors, and taken a few years’ worth of dance classes. She’d been made friends with and learned under countless performers throughout the course of her life, and every one of them seemed to have their own outlook on what performance was. Some said it was like a test, where the song or the routine was akin to a set of questions, and the joy of a great performance came from acing all of them. Others said it was more like a ritual, and that joy came from an innate connection with performers of the past, and the inspiration given to performers of the future. A great many said that performance at its core was communication with one’s own self, and the core joy was unlocked for performer and audience member alike through authentic expression.  Quinn thought all of these interpretations were reasonable, if flawed. The test interpretation left little room for improvisation and embellishment, unless of course those were questions on the test, which would then in turn penalize faithful adaptations of source material. The ritual interpretation seemed to her a bit naive in its belief that all performance had self-imbued value. It didn’t account for the undeniable existence of poor, unskilled, or malicious performance, best lost to time and history, separated from the great acts both passed on and to come. The self-expression idea was perhaps closest, but Quinn still reasoned that the vast majority of performances were regurgitations of someone else’s work, and that any expression reflected the original author or artist at least as much as the performer themself.  What Quinn had come to believe was that performance was debate. Attention is a valuable commodity, something that can be bought, sold, haggled over, stolen, wasted, returned, gifted. Whenever she would stand on a stage, she adopted the viewpoint that whatever work she was interpreting was worth the considerable price of the audience’s attention. She assigned the audience the viewpoint that their attention was too precious to spend on whatever it was she was doing.  Her skill, the one she had so many years ago, and the one she aimed to apply that night, was her knowledge of where, precisely, she was in that debate. There was the all-important opening statement, in which she would outline her abilities, without giving too much away. She can carry a tune, she can hit that note, she can manage a vibrato. Sow an early seed of doubt in their minds. She’d see eyes look up from phones, conversations begin to fragment and die off. They had communicated to her. She knew to listen.",1076,1,23,453,12,0.0794701986754967,0.11037527593819,0.0485651214128035,0.0684326710816777,0.0419426048565121,0.112582781456954,0.233995584988962,0.00441501103752759,0.0264900662251656,0.0971302428256071,0.011037527593819,0.130242825607064,0.0286975717439294,0,0.139072847682119,0,0,0.000241761583777716,0.000241761583778281,0.000241761583778563,0.99830766891355,0.000241761583777388,0.00024176158377955,0.000241761583779626,0.000241761583778307
"1077","Then, there were the chief arguments. She had to know what she was up against, always– in this case, it was the length of the song, the instrumental sections, the people more interested in snapping pictures of their drinks than taking in their surroundings. She knew she had to rebut these arguments either directly, or through the strength of her own arguments. Once she had opened how she wanted to open, she began to test the waters of persuasion. She embellished, she took a few notes up an octave, she threw in some added harmonies with Valerie, who was not such a bad singer herself.  The audience was breaking down. By the end of the second chorus, they had the head and shoulders of nearly everyone in the bar. Well, what about the long guitar solo? What are you, just gonna stand around and wait for it to be over? No, that wouldn’t work. So, it was only logical for Quinn to lick her lips, go back-to-back with Valerie, and rip one of the meanest air-guitar solos of all time.  Was it cheesy? Sure, but Quinn knew better than to always do the most dignified and responsible thing during performance. The song was dated, the bar was cheap, it was a virtual certainty that air guitar with the hottest girl in the building would play well. And it did. The massive crowd of people hollered, and raised their arms, and turned their phone flashlights on.

"1078","Finally, there was the closing argument. She knew that the last thirty seconds or so of any performance were what really stuck with audience members. During occasions when the debate was not going so well for her, she tended to employ a strategy similar to her opening, in an attempt to at least send people home convinced that she was good, if nothing more. But tonight, she got the sense that she had a chance to make the audience see her point of view in an even stronger way than she saw it herself. She drew herself up, and got under the skin of the song and the performer, felt everything as deeply as she could. She cocked her head back, a mane of blonde, now, and strutted across the stage, stepping around each irksome nail with grace and dexterity she seemed to lack in every other context. As sweat dripped down her face, she delivered the last line, bowed, and submitted her performance to the judges, in a sea of darkness. Oh, how she had won. The cheering from the crowd shook the foundation of the bar. Valerie ran up from behind her and gave her a bear hug. It was as natural to her as breathing; as logical as addition or subtraction. But it excited people to a wholly irrational degree.  That was why she used to love it so much. Quinn was vaguely aware of her trek back to the bar. Men and women congratulated her, tousled her hair, rubbed her shoulder, offered to buy her and Valerie a drink. She responded to them, and she knew that Valerie was still hanging on to her, but she did not truly wake up until she sat back down on her stool and heard Coop speak.

"1080","Quinn turned over shoulder and nearly jumped out of her seat. Valerie was standing there, just behind the booth. God, she thought. I must have really been sleeping. ""We’ve done this karaoke thing a long time, and it’s got a pretty loyal following, as I’m sure you can tell. What you guys did, I haven’t seen that in twenty-two years working here."" Quinn glanced at Valerie. Her eyes were just like Coop’s had been– glossed over, aimed idly, in her case, at one of the dozens of framed photographs that hung on the wall next to the racks of drinks. Clearly, she hadn’t come out of the temporary coma that Quinn had just exited. ""...Anyway, I wanted to let you know that if you’d like to, we’re looking for some acts.

"1082","""Oh,"" said Quinn, motioning to stand up. ""Okay. Uh, Gary, we’ll be right back."" Quinn wrapped her arm around Valerie and led her toward the bathroom, which fortunately was located at the opposite end of the bar from the stage, away from the density of the crowd. As they walked, quicker than Quinn might have expected, given Valerie’s condition, Quinn turned around to see purple-faced Coop gnawing Gary’s ear off about something of certain importance.  There were three stalls and three sinks in the bathroom, and they all looked equally unappealing to use. Valerie raced into a stall missing the top corner of its door. Quinn halted at the entrance.

"1086","Quinn scratched her head. The door swung open into the bathroom, so she’d need some way to wedge it closed. Though there was not much to the small bathroom, the trash barrel was nearly overflowing, and when Quinn wiggled it, she was convinced it would hold the weight of the door. First, she tried to slide the barrel the three feet or so it needed to travel to block the door. Unfortunately, whatever gunk had adhered itself to the rest of the bar’s floor had doubled in thickness here, causing the bin to remain firmly in place.  Her next idea was to pick it up completely, and shuffle it over to the door. When she tried this, however, she learned that it must have been in season for guests of this bar to throw away their cinder blocks in the bathroom. She lifted until she was certain straining any harder was going to throw out her back.

She extended her arms as far out as they could go in an effort to keep the detritus from ending up on her shirt.

The plaza was separated from the main road by a dirt hill of considerable incline. Valerie, who ran quite well, once again abandoned her shoes to make the climb, this time for good. Quinn, swallowing every thought that threatened to surface, dug both of her hands into soil and trailed her upwards. The odd plant or rock made the already sheer ascent plenty dangerous. But the fact that the obstacles hid in complete darkness left the health of their wrists and ankles to blind fate. On multiple occasions, Quinn felt her foothold give out, and each time, she waited to tumble all the way down the mountain and into the waiting arms of the employees of the bar, if she managed to survive the fall.

"1103","Quinn had to chuckle. Down below, the scene had begun to lose its novelty, and most of the onlookers had re-entered the bar. A few, however, had fanned out in separate directions in a half-hearted search for the perpetrators. ""Oh, shit,"" said Valerie, smiling, grabbing hold of Quinn. ""We gotta keep running."" And so the two jogged hand in hand on uneven sidewalk under the glow of flickering street lights. The cool air and the shine of Valerie’s hair and the small thwack that her socks made as they hit the concrete made this leg of their escape feel much less dire than the last. They turned around, shouted, made each other run faster. Quinn knew that she was breathing heavily, and that her lungs should have been burning, but that didn’t apply to her, not now. She knew that Valerie could have lied to her, or misread her father’s situation with Gary, and that the police, or even the boys they had run out on, could be waiting for them around any corner.

Quinn kicked off her shoes, and they were eye-to-eye, mouth-to-mouth. This was it. Valerie undid each button on Quinn’s shirt, slid it off, unzipped her jeans, wrestled them off her hips.

"1139","Yes, it was very familiar. Perhaps it was a smell she had stored in her subconscious. She stopped and breathed deeply. There was something beyond the dirt and the dew, she was sure of it. She needed to think. Ideas and feelings rolled around, crashed into one another, shattered.  She kept forward through long grass and the low hum of crickets. Her whole body had atrophied. She misstepped and landed on her back. The stars spun above her. How long had it been? Weeks? Months? More? As she reoriented herself, she attempted to shake the wretched hibernation from her muscles. Time stretched and separated her from sleep further.

"1140","Still, she could not place it. The scent was deep and almost natural, nearly of a clearing in a forest, where water glided over rocks and low plants grew in patches of sunlight. But there was something peculiar about it, something that made her sure that the place she was headed had not existed for very long. The familiarity, the artificiality, the climate, the stars… She put it together just as she laid eyes upon it. She walked over wood chips, processed to avoid giving splinters to small children, climbed up a slide made from elements that may have once existed deep in the Earth, watched a fountain that spouted water processed miles away.  She was at her elementary school playground. Alongside hundreds like her. The entire area seemed to live. Though it was a timid life, it was a steady one, with more of them approaching the swingset or the rusty monkey bars through the field with each passing moment. Thousands of claws and necks and backs stretched, white eyes blinked, knots of exposed flesh brushed against cold metal and soft skin.

Traffic was light, as it was a late Tuesday morning, which allowed him to accelerate to appreciable speeds most of the time. But whenever he saw another vehicle– behind, in front, on another road, even– he slowed to the speed limit until he was sure they were alone again. At one point, he even stopped at a yellow light he could have easily made, earning a thwack on the arm from his copilot.  Quinn watched his eyes through the rearview mirror. They were everywhere. Left, right, forward, back. Left, right, forward, back. Occasionally, he would turn his whole body to look behind him, as though he were reversing. His eyes asked a constant question of the environment around him, and it was difficult to guess what answer he was looking for.

"1280","Whether it was Ty’s restlessness or the smell of the car or the events of the last few days, Quinn developed an anxiety that was unlike any she had felt before. It grabbed at her, toyed with her breathing, lengthened the pins stuck in her foot. Three days, now, on her deathbed. Three days and this was the first moment she felt anything but detachment.  What would she miss? Certainly not much. If the past year was an indication, she’d have worked her deadbeat job for years, perhaps found an apartment somewhere, and lived out the rest of her adult life keeping to herself as much as possible, to limit the pain. She would have had to keep killing and live with increasing, unbounded guilt. She would have had to get old, feel her body break down. And die anyway. Death ends the pain. Death ends the pain forever. Still anxious. Who would she miss? Who did she have? Her father was gone. Her sister was gone. Her mother? Gone for so long, gone for so much? Certainly not her. She loved her grandparents, but they didn’t know her. Ty did, kind of. No, he used her, thought she could be scored or thrown away, or paraded around like an animal, anyway. Val didn’t, either.
